Gasoline-powered leaf blowers are a major contributor to urban air pollution because almost all run on compact two-stroke engines. While power-dense, two stroke engines produce significant air pollution because lubricant oil is mixed with the fuel in the engine's combustion chamber. The high levels of pollutants emitted by the exhaust from leaf blowers, such as nitrous oxide, contribute to urban air pollution and damage the health of the most vulnerable city residents.   Furthermore, gasoline-powered leaf blowers are a major contributor to urban noise pollution. Gasoline-powered leaf blowers can emit sound levels of up to 120 decibels at full power, which can cause permanent hearing damage with prolonged exposure. The negative effects on urban residents are palpable, especially when viable alternatives exist.  Electric leaf blowers have advanced significantly in the past decade. With powerful lithium ion battery technology, electric leaf blowers offer comparable or superior performance to gasoline-powered leaf blowers without the emissions. There are no real advantages remaining to gasoline-powered leaf blowers—they are more polluting, less reliable, emit significant noise pollution, and degrade urban air quality. All of these negative externalities are issues which simply cannot be addressed by personal choice alone.  While some may argue that individual residents should be able to choose between electric and gasoline power, that argument ignores the significant drawbacks of continuing to allow highly-polluting gasoline-powered leaf blowers to remain on the market. To transition leaf blowers to clean, four-stroke engines equipped with catalytic converters would make such leaf blowers almost prohibitively expensive for the average consumer.

For instance, during recent school emergencies, students quickly alerted authorities or parents using smartphones, enabling faster responses and improved outcomes.   On the topic of digital responsibility, with structured guideline supervised use, schools can help students develop healthy habits with boundaries. Schools can implement digital citizenship curricula like Common Sense Education, which has proven effective in improving students' online behavior and decision-making skills. Studies show that students participating in digital citizenship programs demonstrate reduced cyberbullying incidents and improved online decision-making skills. Better informed choices would lead to better discipline and help prepare for the complete digital world.   Smart phones also act as tools of inclusion. For students without access to computers or internet at home, phones may be their only gateway to online learning. If a student is having trouble with translations, needs audio readers or other types of assist, a smartphone can help bridge the gap by increasing productivity for those who need it.   In conclusion, a balanced and thoughtful approach to smartphones will allow schools to focus on the benefits of use while minimizing risks. When used wisely and sparse, phones can empower students, increase safety and help teach tech awareness to students. Rather than seeing smartphones as a threat, we should exercise their advantages. "

Freedom of rights for citizens being impacted. 2nd Pre: Suggestions for alternatives and proposal qualities (eco friendly, noise quieter, environmental health overall) and how to impose, or ban entirely. Conclusion: What needs to be done for the residents QOL and safety of the biodiversity of the insect world and animal kingdom before it reaches humanity. ","In this essay I will explore the affects of gas powered leaf blowers and how these tools are damaging the insect habitat, taking a toll on the citizens; their mental health, environment, quality of life, and explore a solution that seeks to improve, if not eliminate the harboring side effects of these garden tools.   Firstly, I want to highlight that leaf blowers impact biodiversity in a myriad of ways. Blowers remove litter, part of their essential habitat as pollinators and decomposers. We know this provides food for birds and other amphibians that are equally important, and often injured or killed - especially small insects that live within leaf piles. Leaf blowers also blow away soil, which pollutes any lakes or rivers nearby with the added fertilizers in them. The grass also suffers, and the environment as a whole, as the nutrients within the soil have been depleted simply for the visual quality of the leaves being a ""nuisance"".   I also want to engage you in the pressing issue of the noise leaf blowers bring to neighbourhoods. These powered tools travel long distance and cause stress, alarm and over-all avoidance of particularly noisy areas, causing an avid drop in tourism and even for animals, travel to the area. Those who have no choice but to live nearby are suffering for somebody else's personal preference.   The personal preference is just that, a preference; it's not necessary and it certainly isn't assisting the globe with the climate crisis we're in. However, the general public have historically not taken kindly to outright bans regarding climate change or any crisis, and often will go out of their way to uphold their freedom of choice to protect their property. In such a hostile time, the only safe means of introducing carbon-free and noise-nuisance-be-gone would be incentivizing electrical leaf blowers.  However, this is easier said than done. Encouraging societal values to change such as hard labour = loud labour is almost impossible to none. The government must take action to implore and remove gas-powered tools from the market, and as such, prevent remaining existing tools from being refuelled to protect the carbon emission output they expel as much as possible. They expel also dust, pollen and some molds from leaf piles too, which isn't as much an animal nuisance as it is a human environmental nightmare.  The decline of the climate is being contributed to daily by the harmful impacts of a visually aesthetically pleasing garden that won't stay green for long if they continue the usage of the gas tools. This would be a useful incentivizing fact to prepare the public for the inevitable switch, as well as informing residents who have been personally identified as owning these tools; specifically speaking - just those in the gardening businesses who may be affected most, and have governmental support funds in place for those who are taking the leap to a climate effective standing.   Therefore, I believe that switching to electrical tools would assist with mitigating the negative impacts, and remain convenient, if not more, reducing the disruption given to the human environment as well as insect habitats. The pollution, both noise and air, will support a full rebuild of the small ecosystems that support a healthy climate and greenery.

Firstly I wish to highlight that leaf blowers impact biodiversity in a myriad of ways. Blowers remove litter from leaf piles, which is part of their essential habitat as pollinators and decomposers.

I also want to engage you in the pressing issue of the noise leaf blowers bring to neighbourhoods, particularly surburban neighbourhoods that have residents who work early, nightshift - anything deemed typically unsociable who are unnecessarily bothered by these tools. The sounds of the leaf blowers travel long distance and cause stress, alarm and ultimately the avoidance of particularly noisy areas, causing an avid drop in tourism, sleeplessness in humans, and animals tend to avoid travelling towards the area. Those who have no choice but to live nearby are suffering for somebody else's personal preference.   The personal preference is just that, a preference; it's not necessary and it certainly isn't assisting the globe with the climate crisis we're in.

The government must take action to implore and remove gas-powered tools from the market, and as such, prevent remaining existing tools from being refuelled to protect the carbon emission output they expel as much as possible. Another major factor is the expulsion primarily being made up of dust, pollen and even molds from leaf piles, which isn't as much an animal nuisance as it is a human environmental nightmare, especially for those suffering with allergies, asthma, or hayfever.  The decline of the climate is being contributed to daily by the harmful impacts of a desire for an aesthetically pleasing garden that won't stay green for long if they continue the usage of these harmful tools. This would be a useful incentivizing fact to prepare the public for the inevitable switch to environmentally friendly tools that are electric, as well as informing residents who have been personally identified as owning these tools; specifically speaking to not impose on freedoms and protections - strictly targeting those in the gardening businesses who may be affected most, and have governmental support funds in place for those who are taking the leap to a climate effective standing to invest in newer equipments.   Finally, I impose that anybody partaking in gardening must make the switch to electrical tools. It would both assist with mitigating the negative impacts as outlined within this essay, and remain convenient whilst singlehandedly supporting a hefty reduction to the disruption of both the human environment and smaller insect habitats. The pollution protection brought by switching to electrical equipment, in terms of both noise and air, will support a full rebuild of the smaller ecosystems that support a healthy climate and greenery.

We can't be sure how it interferes with other wildlife.   Potential pathogens? - Probably not.   Nature adhors a void. Where we see devestation, nature sees a canvas to paint. Destroyed ecosystems can become vibrant if we back off.   Moral argument - is there any limit to what we should reintroduce? Are we responsible for every creature that ever existed? What about the other animals that would die to make ecological space for newly introduced animals.   No animal lives in isolation, its part of a greater whole. ","Behold the humble rabbit. Cute. Floppy-eared. Good for hunting? Thomas Austin thought so, what could possibly be the harm in bringing a few with him to his new home to hunt in his idle time. A century later, Australia is still living with the consequences of that decision. Without any natural predators, the two dozen rabbits introduced by Mr Austin bred out of control, utterly devastating the local ecosystem as they ate through everything vaguely edible.  There are two lessons to learn from Mr Austin, other than that bunnies are secretly terrifying. First is that humans have a terrible track record in trying to control ecosystems, and once unleashed, it can be far harder to fix than it was to originally execute. Second, no animal exists in isolation, it exists as part of an ecosystem. Plucking species out or inserting new species in is like thinking you can replace a jenga piece with a gooey slab of jello and that because they're both roughly the same shape, they'll serve the same purpose.   So too with reintroducing the wooly mammoth. This wasn't an animal that existed in isolation, it existed in concert with its ecosystem which kept both it and its environment in balance. While it's sad the mammoth is now gone, the ecosystem has already adapted to its loss, and you can't just slot one piece back in and think everything is fine than that jello piece is going to be a reliable building block.  Further, nature is an ever-changing force. The world is not what it once was, and the future will not be how it is now. Trying to force the future to mirror the past is anathema to the fundamental nature of... nature. The era of the wooly mammoth is gone, and that's made room for other species.

Hybrid schedules provide an effective balance benefiting both employers and employees","The question of whether employees should be required to work from the office or if they may work remotely from home has become a hot topic of discussion in recent years, particularly in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. As more and more companies begin to roll out return to office mandates, the question becomes even more relevant: Should large employers require workers to return to the office several days a week, or allow fully remote schedules by default? While there are benefits to working in the office, such as building a sense of community amongst employees, there are also just as many benefits to working remotely, such as saving time and money on commuting. Thus, a third option is introduced: the hybrid work schedule.  A hybrid work schedule is a money-saving move, both for the employer and the employee. Employees save money in a variety of ways, including spending less money on childcare, gas, parking, and paying for lunch at work. At the same time, the employer sees a financial benefit - fewer days in the office results in a lower utility bill and spending less in rent for your office space. Hence, the financial benefits can be reaped by both parties.  In addition, hybrid work allows for the perfect amount of flexibility in scheduling and supports work-life balance for employees. Employees who are not spending time commuting are afforded extra time to spend on hobbies, engaging in self-care, or with their families and friends. Employees who have time to spend at home are less likely to experience burnout and more likely to be productive employees. This flexible schedule also allows a company culture to be built, creating a sense of community amongst employees. Overall, the flexible schedule of hybrid work provides benefits to the employees that, in turn, cause increased productivity at work and better outcomes for the employer.  Finally, a hybrid work schedule allows companies to attract and retain top talent. It also promotes enhancing productivity of workers and boosts satisfaction/morale amongst employees.

""How are these wretched machines even allowed?"" I have muttered to myself multiple times. The bottom line is that they shouldn't be. Cities and towns are well within their rights to outlaw the use of leaf blowers within their city limits, and I am strongly in favor of the idea that they do just that.  There is precedent for this in many cities and towns already. The entirety of Southern California is governed by a board who instituted a leaf blower turn-in/disposal program. Companies and individuals received incentives to hand their pieces of equipment over. This was met with enormous success. Absent a small yet pervasive cause of noise and pollution, the cities in the area were that much cleaner. Incentives for landscaping companies and homeowners who take part in such a program could go a long way in encouraging people to clear these awful things out of their garages or sheds. Discounts on energy bills, water, anything that a city could reasonably offer people would encourage word of mouth to spread just as quickly, as would social media posts about such a program.  On the other hand, penalties could be imposed on those who do not cease the usage of leaf blowers. No landscaping company is going to want bad press or lack of support from an entire city. Homeowners aren't going to enjoy penalties or fines either. In the spirit of moderation, a rule could be enacted that leaf blowers could only be used if it is out of earshot of any other property, and can only be used for a set amount of time in a day.

Most students bring their phones to class, but these devices often serve as more of a distraction than a help during the school day. The debate over whether public schools should ban smartphones or allow limited use is ongoing, reflecting the challenge of balancing technology's benefits with its drawbacks.  On the positive side, smartphones can be valuable tools for learning. They grant students quick access to educational resources, digital textbooks, and research materials, which can enhance classroom activities and assignments. Furthermore, having a phone during emergencies is reassuring for both students and parents. In urgent situations, students can immediately call for help or contact family members, ensuring safety and timely communication.  However, the disadvantages of allowing unrestricted smartphone use are significant. Phones often divert students' attention from lessons, leading to decreased focus and poorer academic performance. Additionally, smartphones can facilitate cheating during tests or assignments by providing access to unauthorized information. Beyond academics, they can also be misused for bullying or other social misconduct, exacerbating issues like cyberbullying within the school environment.  Given these considerations, I believe that smartphones should be permitted on campus but must be turned off and stored away during instructional time. This policy strikes a balance by allowing phones for emergencies or specific educational activities as exceptions while minimizing distractions. By keeping phones out of sight most of the time, schools can foster a more focused learning atmosphere without completely banning technology.

Unknown outcomes Final cnclusion =  Parents should have the right to genetically edit their unboirn  children as it prevents adverse disease like MND from occurring and protects future generations.  It need to be controlled to eliminate ",,"With remarkable advancements in science and genetics, society now faces a profound ethical dilemma: should parents have the right to genetically edit their unborn children to prevent diseases, or should genetic modifications be banned to preserve natural human diversity? This debate centers around two main perspectives—one advocating for the benefits of genetic editing in eliminating hereditary diseases, and the other warning against the risks of diminishing human diversity and the potential for misuse.  Proponents of genetic editing argue that allowing parents to modify the genes of their unborn children can significantly reduce the burden of genetic diseases. Conditions such as Motor Neuron Disease (MND) and Huntington’s disease are devastating, often leading to severe physical and cognitive decline. By enabling parents to eliminate these genetic disorders before birth, children can be spared a lifetime of suffering and uncertainty. This preventative approach not only improves the quality of life for the individual but also relieves families and society from emotional and financial hardships associated with hereditary diseases.  On the other hand, opponents of genetic editing emphasize the importance of preserving natural human diversity. They argue that interfering with the human genome raises complex ethical questions and opens the door to potentially dangerous practices. For instance, if genetic editing is permitted to prevent diseases, where should we draw the line? Could parents start selecting traits such as gender to avoid gender-specific diseases, or modify skin color to reduce the risk of skin cancer? Such scenarios highlight concerns about creating a slippery slope that could lead to “designer babies” and exacerbate social inequalities. Furthermore, the long-term consequences of altering the human genome remain unknown, posing risks not only to individuals but to the genetic makeup of future generations.  In conclusion, parents should have the right to genetically edit their unborn children to prevent serious diseases like Motor Neuron Disease, as this technology offers a powerful means to protect future generations from avoidable suffering. However, it is essential that such practices are strictly regulated to prevent misuse and to safeguard the diversity and integrity of humanity. Careful oversight can ensure that genetic editing serves as a tool for health and well-being, rather than a means to impose subjective ideals on the next generation.","With the rapid advancements in genetic science, a profound ethical debate has emerged regarding whether parents should have the right to genetically edit their unborn children. This discussion centers on two primary perspectives, one that supports genetic modification to prevent diseases and relieve suffering, and another that argues that such interventions should be banned for the purposes of preserving natural human diversity. Both viewpoints raise important considerations about the ethics of  genetic science intervention and the role of it plays in human diversity and quality of life.  Proponents of genetic editing highlight the significant benefits it can bring, particularly in the prevention of debilitating diseases, such as Motor Neuron Disease (MND) and Huntington’s disease. Both are potential inherited genetic disorders that have devastating effects on individuals and their families. By allowing parents to edit the genes of their unborn children, these diseases could potentially be eradicated before birth, sparing children a life of fear and suffering. The ability to prevent such hereditary illnesses  improves the quality of life for current and future generations.  Conversely, opponents caution against the wide-scale use of genetic modifications, emphasizing the importance of preserving natural human diversity. They argue that if genetic editing is permitted, the boundaries of its application could easily become blurred, leading to ethically questionable practices such as selecting a child’s gender or physical traits like skin color.  Some may justify these choices by appealing to disease prevention such as selecting lighter skin to reduce the risk of skin cancer, however the long-term consequences and social implications of such interventions are unpredictable and potentially harmful. Moreover, these practices could contribute to new forms of inequality and discrimination, undermining the very diversity that enriches human society.  In conclusion, parents should have the right to genetically edit their unborn children, particularly when it comes to preventing serious diseases like Motor Neuron Disease and Huntington’s disease. Such interventions have the potential to protect future generations from immense suffering.

Briefly highlight two points on why they should be banned. Add one or two points that highlight the negatives of why they could be helpful. Wrap up sentence that ties into the first body paragraph.  Body Paragraph 1: Highlighting first supporting point.   Body Paragraph 2: Highlight second supporting point.  Body Paragraph 3: Opposite points of view highlighted and rebuttal as to why it might be a good thing to have phones in school.  Closing Paragraph: Reiterate points on why they should be banned and try to close out the essay.,,"In today’s increasingly digital world, children are growing up surrounded by advanced technology, including smartphones. While it is undeniable that smartphones have become an integral part of daily life, the debate over whether public schools should ban them during the school day remains highly relevant. Smartphones can be a distraction and hinder academic performance, yet they also offer potential benefits such as facilitating emergency communication and supporting learning when used appropriately. Despite the positives, the negatives outweigh the benefits, making a strong case for banning smartphones in schools.  One primary reason for banning smartphones is the distraction they cause in the classroom. Students are easily tempted to check social media, play games, or text friends, which detracts from their focus on lessons and learning activities. This divided attention can lead to lower retention of information and a decline in overall academic performance. Teachers often struggle to maintain classroom discipline when students are preoccupied with their devices, which negatively impacts the learning environment for the entire class.  Another significant concern is the impact of smartphones on students’ mental health and social skills. Constant connectivity can increase anxiety, reduce face-to-face interactions, and contribute to cyberbullying. When smartphones are banned, students are more likely to engage directly with peers and focus on developing interpersonal skills critical for their future success. This healthier social engagement fosters a positive atmosphere that supports both emotional well-being and academic growth.  On the other hand, proponents argue that smartphones can be useful tools for learning and emergency situations. Limited, supervised use could allow students to access educational apps or contact parents if necessary. However, these benefits can be achieved through school-provided technology or controlled communication channels without the distraction and risks that personal smartphones bring into the classroom.  In conclusion, while smartphones offer some advantages, the potential distractions and negative effects on students’ focus and mental health justify banning them during the school day. By eliminating smartphones, schools can create a more conducive environment for learning and personal development, ensuring that students gain the most from their education in this digital age.","In today’s increasingly digital world, children are experiencing different challenges than previous generations and one of those problems comes from the rampant use of smartphones. While it is undeniable that smartphones have become an integral part of daily life, there is debate among parents, teachers and students about whether or not smartphones should be allowed in school.

This divided attention can lead to lower retention of information and a decline in overall academic performance. Teachers often struggle to maintain classroom discipline when students are preoccupied with their devices, which negatively impacts the learning environment for the entire class. So even students that are not constantly using their phones suffer from the decline of quality in their education.  Another significant concern is the impact of smartphones on students’ mental health and social skills. Constant connectivity can increases anxiety, reduces in person interactions and contributes to cyberbullying. When smartphones are banned, students are more likely to engage directly with their peers and focus on developing interpersonal skills critical for their future success. This healthier social engagement fosters a positive atmosphere that supports both emotional well-being and academic growth. It also helps children develop social skills that will help them later in life.  On the other hand, proponents argue that smartphones can be useful tools for learning and useful in emergency situations. Many parents argue that their children need their phones in order to communicate with them in the event of a school emergency. The benefit of this can not be understated and it has been useful in previous school shootings. However, these benefits can be achieved through school-provided technology or controlled communication channels without the distraction and risks that personal smartphones bring into the classroom.  In conclusion, while smartphones offer some advantages, the potential distractions and negative effects on students’ focus and mental health justify banning them during the school day.

If they prove that they can do their work proficiently at home, there is no need to comeback to work in person. Working in person only adds several obstacles as people have to wake up earlier and get ready for work. It is better for people to simply choose what they're comfortable with.  ","     Workers should have the ability to have a fully remote schedule by default. One advantage of a fully remote schedule is the ability to have the privacy of your own home. Studies have shown that people that those who work from their own home often show greater productivity at work. These people are fully comfortable from their own homes, and do not feel the pressure of an office space. If an individual has shown that they are capable of fully working from their home, there is no reason to stop them. There is often pressure from offices to force people to return back to in-person work. Allowing people to work from their own homes also increases satisfaction. People are compelled to work harder, so that they can keep their job. In turn, there is greater worker retention. People are less likely to leave a job when they feel satisfied, and feel that they are being treated right.            Another advantage of a fully remote schedule is that employers will have the ability to lower costs. They will have to pay less for things such as rent, supplies, utilities, etc. This allows them to maintain higher profits, and in turn invest their money into more important things which align with their company goals. Another advantage is that employers have a more wide spread of potential employees. They are not limited to the geographically limited area of their city/state, and can look into employees from all over the world. This allows them to have a large talent pool that they can look into. In conclusion, there are many advantages of a fully remote schedule.

How would reintroducing species that have naturally gone extinct affect natural habitats (many of which we are already in danger of forever losing), the food chain, and would this drive other species into extinction by way of increased competition for food?  For example, if we were to reintroduce the Saber-toothed tigers into the wild, would this have a detrimental impact on regular tiger population, which are already an endangered species. Most likely, it would. Not only would the Sabre-tooth compete with the smaller tigers for territory, they would likely drive tiger species even lower as they would take a chunk of the available food.

There must me other ways to prevent diseases in unborn children that are more ethical ? ",,"The advent of genetic editing technology has sparked significant ethical debates, particularly surrounding the question of whether parents should have the right to genetically modify their unborn children to prevent diseases. While the desire to eliminate suffering is understandable, intervening in the natural genetic makeup of humans is an unnatural act that raises profound moral and practical concerns. Humans should not attempt to control or interfere with natural biological processes that have evolved over millennia.  One of the primary reasons for caution is the uncertainty surrounding the long-term risks of gene editing. Despite advances in science, we do not yet fully understand the potential consequences of altering human DNA. Genetic changes made today could have unforeseen and possibly detrimental effects on future generations, potentially introducing new health problems or reducing genetic diversity in unpredictable ways. The complexity of the human genome means that even well-intentioned modifications carry risks that science has not yet fully mapped.  Furthermore, banning genetic modifications in unborn children would help preserve natural human diversity, which is vital for the resilience and adaptability of our species. Genetic variation plays a crucial role in preventing widespread vulnerability to diseases and environmental changes. By allowing nature to take its own course, we honor the evolutionary processes that have shaped humanity and maintain the rich genetic tapestry that contributes to the strength and uniqueness of individuals and populations.  Moreover, there are ethical and potentially safer alternatives to preventing diseases in unborn children. Prenatal screenings, improved maternal healthcare, and advances in medical treatments offer ways to reduce the incidence and impact of genetic diseases without resorting to genetic editing. These methods respect human life and diversity while still addressing health concerns.  In conclusion, while the impulse to eradicate disease is noble, parents and society should refrain from genetically editing unborn children. The risks and ethical implications are significant, and preserving natural human diversity is essential. Instead, we should seek more ethical and tested approaches to support the health of future generations.","Genetic editing technology has raised many important ethical questions, particularly whether parents should have the right to genetically modify their unborn children to prevent diseases.

Safety measures must be in place at all times. Anything less than 99% safety should be re-evaluated.     ","The topic of whether or not we should, as parents, be able to genetically edit our unborn children to further enhance their quality of life is an interesting one. On one hand we want to do everything we can to keep our children safe, both in the present and future, but to what lengths can we ethically go to ensure this. Using science and technology to remove the threat of diseases in our unborn children is curious, and raises the question of how far is too far. What wouldn't we do to ensure a good life for our children, and how much will it cost?  I believe the idea is certainly worth exploring. As a future parent, I would be most concerned with the various diseases we hear about from other parents. Diseases that can, and do, impact their children from birth an throughout life. If I had the chance to simply 'delete' this possibility before my child was born, it would be quite enticing. Why wouldn't you want to ensure your child has the best and brightest future, health-wise? The problem however is, how safe is it? Is it morally correct? Will this actually end up causing more issues down the line, and throughout life? At what point do you stop modifying?   If we could explore this concept while being reasonable, objective and above all safe then we might have a feasible conversation. Yes, we want to remove all threat of diseases, but we might have a threshold we can and shouldn't cross. There will always be some new disease around the corner, and what happens then? Do we go in and get our child 'upgraded' to deal with this? I think there is a couple diseases that have plagued us that we could certainly make use of science and technology to help children of the future deal with easier and if it requires a slight tweak of our genetic code, then that could be a potential avenue to explore, but before we get carried away we must ensure safety. This is research that must be carried out over a long period of time as I feel that any parent hearing anything below 99.9% chance of success will raise an eyebrow.   While I certainly agree on the topic and support the concept of it, I won't risk my child's life until we have research and good, sound evidence that this is a possibility.

Drawbacks include a lack of flexibility, expensive commuting costs, and potentially lower productivity due to exhaustion.  It is important to make sure that the benefits and drawbacks are carefully considered before making a policy to allow or disallow remote work.","Allowing people to work from home full time versus requiring people to work in the office at least some time or full time is an interesting debate. It is important to allow people to choose what they feel is best for them, but at the same time, workers should be at least somewhat responsible for how they perform at the company as they are paid a significant amount of money to do their jobs in a way that allows the company to grow. Workers need to be able to produce more than it costs for the company to hire them, and the company needs to be able to monitor how each worker performs in order to be able to maintain profits. If people have to work in the office at least some time, then it is easier for the company to monitor them as they can see patterns of whether or not someone has been able to complete their tasks on time in the office or whether they are significantly faster in the office than at home or slower in the office than at home. People may also be more motivated at work if they have to work in the office at least a few days a week because they can separate work and personal life by being in different locations, which may prevent them from being distracted at work or may allow them to fully separate themselves at home when the work day is over. On the other hand, if people are allowed to work from home all the time, then they may take advantage of this when they feel like they cannot be monitored by intentionally working slower than they would at the office or by working large amounts of overtime which may not be possible in an office setting. Managing employees productivity by monitoring instead of giving them full freedom however also has some drawbacks. For example, people may feel like they cannot be as productive at the office because they have to spend time commuting which can also be expensive and leave them feeling like they cannot make it through the day compared to if they were allowed to work from home. They may also feel like they cannot work as flexibly, which may cause them to not be able to work and balance personal or family life at the same time compared to if they have to work at home.

However, it is important to ensure that both the advantages and disadvantages of working from home full time versus having to come to the office a few days a week are considered before a company decides on a remote work policy.

62f1b2691a5ac1c03a9987a0,3,a3,"Many employers report that employees boast improved productivity and better job satisfaction when they use the option to work remotely, but is that really true? Anecdotally, all of the workers I know that work from home spend significant portions of their day doing chores, shopping online, and simply browsing social media on the phone. If this is remotely true for even a significant portion of others, why is the productivity increasing? Simply put, employees were never putting in good effort in the office. These employees seem to operate in bursts, alternating between almost 100% breaks and extremely concerted effort. So, is this truly the result of WFH scheduling? Likely not. In fact, this observation could be an argument for a more militant style of management and a condensed work week, resulting in further increases in employee pay per hour. ",,"The debate over whether large employers should require workers to return to the office several days a week or allow fully remote schedules by default has gained significant attention in recent years. Many employers report that employees exhibit improved productivity and better job satisfaction when given the option to work remotely. However, this notion warrants closer scrutiny to understand if these claims truly reflect the reality of remote work.  Anecdotally, many workers who work from home spend considerable portions of their day engaged in non-work-related activities such as doing household chores, shopping online, or browsing social media. If such behavior is common among a substantial number of remote employees, it raises an important question: how is overall productivity apparently improving under these conditions? One plausible explanation is that employees were not fully committed or productive even while working in traditional office settings. Instead, workers might naturally operate in bursts of intense focus interspersed with lengthy periods of low or no productivity. This pattern likely persisted regardless of the work environment.  Therefore, it is questionable to attribute improvements in productivity and job satisfaction solely to remote work schedules. Instead, the data may reveal a deeper issue regarding employee engagement and management practices. If productivity fluctuates significantly regardless of location, it suggests a need for more structured and effective management approaches. For instance, adopting a more disciplined and focused management style, coupled with a condensed workweek, might better optimize employee output. Such changes could allow employees to concentrate their efforts into shorter, highly productive work periods, which could, in turn, justify higher pay rates per hour worked.  In conclusion, while remote work offers undeniable flexibility and certain benefits, the reported increases in productivity may not stem directly from employees’ location shifts. Instead, it may underscore longstanding patterns of work behavior and a management style in need of reform. Large employers should carefully consider these factors before deciding whether to mandate office returns or embrace fully remote schedules as the default.","The debate over whether large employers should require workers to return to the office several days a week or allow fully remote schedules by default has gained significant attention in recent years.

Students might also use them for negative things like watching porn or even spreading misinformation in some cases. Alternative tablets like an iPad can still be used for learning but it has to be very restricted and less personal.",,"In today’s digital age, smartphones have become an integral part of daily life, offering convenience and instant access to information. However, their presence in public schools during the school day raises significant concerns. While some argue that smartphones can enhance learning and provide a means for emergencies, I believe that schools should ban smartphones during school hours. The reasons for this are primarily rooted in the issues of distraction, addiction, and misuse.  Firstly, smartphones are highly addictive and a major source of distraction within the learning environment. With constant notifications from social media, games, and messaging apps, students find it challenging to focus on their lessons. This distraction not only hampers individual academic performance but also disrupts the overall classroom atmosphere. Teachers often struggle to keep students engaged when their attention is divided between the lesson and their devices.  Secondly, the misuse of smartphones by students presents a serious problem. Aside from distraction, smartphones can facilitate access to inappropriate content such as pornography, which is harmful to young minds. Moreover, these devices can be channels for spreading misinformation or engaging in cyberbullying, both of which can have detrimental effects on the school community. Allowing unrestricted smartphone use during school hours essentially opens doors to these negative behaviors.  As a viable alternative, schools could permit the use of tablets such as iPads for educational purposes. These devices can be controlled and restricted to ensure they are used solely for learning, minimizing distractions and misuse. Unlike personal smartphones, tablets provided by schools are less personal and can be monitored more effectively, which helps maintain a productive learning environment.  In conclusion, despite the benefits of smartphones in everyday life, their presence during the school day poses significant challenges.

673378009f99d14c232c1f2b,3,b3,"The age old question do we take what we learn from the past and apply to todays standards in a productive and efficient manner. Should the federal government broaden student loan forgiveness programs that make us unaccountable for our actions or do we move forward and prioritize other new ways to address education debt. First let me state that I grew up in a time in which you never borrowed what you couldn't repay, or at least intend to repay earnestly. Now todays society looks more and more like a game of monopoly in which you declare a winner and they act like you can simply claim a winner and start a new. Personally i went to college worked two jobs built character and learned from listens on my way and after all isn't college is a journey of not only knowledge but self discovery. And like most who i grew up realized this and have mostly paid off their loans to date and others finishing their offs whether they became successful or did something with it is a different story. But we need to hold be accountable as we were growing up and if we encourage that type of behavior they wont work hard to strive for anything or have to self sacrifice in order to determine character but also find themselves. Thus college is a journey or self exploration and knowledge we should prioritize more effort of giving a flat $10,000 reduction in student debt as an alternative to reducing student debt as inflation and value of currency has to some aspect been our generations fault to some degree which for some has made there possibility of paying off their debt achieving similar to be able to purchase a house at todays economic uncertainty.",,"The debate over whether the federal government should broaden student-loan forgiveness programs or prioritize alternative methods to address education debt is one that invokes deep questions about accountability, personal responsibility, and economic reality. Reflecting on past values, many of us grew up with a clear understanding that borrowing should be done only if there was a firm intention and ability to repay. Today, however, student loans sometimes feel like a game of Monopoly—where debt is reset or forgiven, potentially eroding the sense of accountability that once guided financial decisions.  In my own experience, attending college meant working two jobs, building character, and learning valuable life lessons along the way. College was not just a pursuit of knowledge but a journey of self-discovery and responsibility. Most of my peers who grew up with these values have managed to repay their loans, regardless of the level of success they ultimately achieved. This commitment to repayment fosters discipline and resilience, qualities essential for personal growth and long-term achievement. If student-loan forgiveness programs are expanded without careful consideration, there is a risk of encouraging a mindset that devalues hard work and sacrifice.  That said, the economic landscape today has shifted, and many borrowers face challenges beyond their control, including inflation and a less stable job market. Thus, while total forgiveness may undermine accountability, a balanced approach that includes measures such as a flat $10,000 reduction in student debt could provide meaningful relief without removing the responsibility to repay entirely. Such a policy acknowledges present economic difficulties while encouraging borrowers to remain committed to managing their debt.  In conclusion, rather than broadly expanding student-loan forgiveness programs, the government should prioritize thoughtful, moderate reforms. These reforms must balance the need for personal accountability with recognition of economic hardships, ensuring that college remains both a path to knowledge and a journey in building character.","The debate over whether the federal government should broaden student-loan forgiveness programs or prioritize alternative methods to address education debt is one that invokes deep questions about accountability, personal responsibility, and economic reality.

Usage during school days should be permitted because the benefits outweigh the cons. One of the main benefits of using a smartphone in school is easy access to educational resources. With just a few clicks, students can look up information, watch educational videos, or read digital textbooks.

(Thesis statement) - I think large employers should embrace a hybrid schedule whereby workers can operate from home and office to optimize worker productivity and promote a healthy work-life balance. First point: A hybrid model ensures that employees enjoy a healthy work-life balance Second point: A hybrid model can help employees remain more productive Conclusion: A hybrid model is the best way to ensure employees remain happy and productive in today's work realities.",,"Return to Office or Fully Remote Work: An Analysis  The Covid-19 pandemic drastically transformed the traditional work environment, prompting many employers to adopt remote work to maintain business continuity. As the world gradually emerges from the pandemic, a pressing question arises: should large employers require workers to return to the office several days a week, or allow fully remote schedules by default? I believe the optimal approach lies in embracing a hybrid schedule, allowing employees to work both from home and the office. This model not only enhances productivity but also promotes a healthy work-life balance.  First and foremost, a hybrid work model supports a healthy work-life balance for employees. By splitting their time between the office and home, workers can better manage personal responsibilities alongside their professional duties. This flexibility reduces stress, lowers burnout rates, and contributes to overall job satisfaction. Employees can schedule time for family, exercise, or hobbies without compromising their work commitments. In contrast, strictly office-based schedules often demand long commutes and rigid hours, while fully remote work can sometimes blur the boundaries between work and personal life, leading to overwork.  Secondly, a hybrid model can significantly boost employee productivity. Working from home several days a week allows employees to leverage quieter environments free from typical office distractions, enabling them to focus on deep work tasks. Conversely, regular in-office days facilitate collaboration, brainstorming sessions, and spontaneous interactions that foster creativity and team cohesion. This balance ensures employees remain engaged and connected while performing at their best. Research has shown that employees in hybrid settings often report higher productivity levels compared to those working exclusively in one environment.  In conclusion, adopting a hybrid work schedule offers large employers a balanced solution that addresses the challenges of both fully remote and fully in-office models. By combining the benefits of flexibility and face-to-face collaboration, a hybrid approach ensures that employees remain happy, motivated, and productive in today’s evolving work landscape. As such, large employers should consider making hybrid schedules the default work arrangement moving forward.","Return to Office or Fully Remote Work: An Analysis  The Covid-19 pandemic drastically transformed the traditional work environment, prompting many employers to adopt remote work to maintain business continuity.

Talking about the economic benefits, increased disposable income, boost to GDP Social benefits, reduced inequalities, increased access to education Counterargument and response, alternative solutions Conclusion, recap main points.",,"The rising education debt crisis in the United States has become an urgent issue affecting millions of Americans. With student loan debt surpassing $1.7 trillion, many individuals struggle to manage their financial obligations, which in turn impacts the broader economy and society. The increasing burden of education debt calls for decisive action from the federal government. Given the widespread effects of this crisis, the government should broaden student loan forgiveness programs to alleviate the burden of education debt and promote economic growth.  One key reason to expand loan forgiveness is the economic benefit it provides. When borrowers are relieved of overwhelming debt, they gain increased disposable income that can be spent on goods, services, and investments. This boost in consumer spending can stimulate economic growth and help expand the nation’s GDP. Additionally, reducing education debt can unlock opportunities for entrepreneurship, homeownership, and retirement savings, which contribute to a more robust economy over the long term.  Beyond economic advantages, broadened loan forgiveness programs have significant social benefits. Student loan debt disproportionately affects low-income and minority communities, exacerbating existing inequalities. By easing this financial burden, more individuals can access higher education without the fear of crippling debt, promoting social mobility and equity. Broader forgiveness programs can thus work as a tool to reduce educational disparities and create a more inclusive society with equal opportunities for success.  Some argue that alternative solutions, such as lowering tuition costs or increasing financial literacy, might better address education debt. While these are important measures, they do not provide immediate relief to those currently burdened by debt. Loan forgiveness programs address the urgent needs of millions while policies to reduce future debt can be implemented in parallel.  In conclusion, broadening student loan forgiveness programs offers crucial economic and social benefits that can help alleviate the mounting education debt crisis.

Imposing location restrictions can hinder their natural workflow and decrease overall efficiency.  A more balanced and productive approach would be to evaluate each employee’s performance both at home and in the office.

You can take out a certain amount, but then interest grows and grows over time where it's so much more money than you originally took out, and you are in deeper financial trouble. A long with other bills, you start paying student loans off the first time after graduating. And many of students have moved out and already have to pay a lot of bills, so how are they going to afford to pay back their student loans when they have to put food on the table? rent money so they don't get kicked out? the federal government should absolutely broaden student loan forgiveness, without question! ",,"Student loans are a reality for millions of Americans seeking higher education, and most borrowers are barely 18 years old when they take on this financial burden. For many, student loans are the only viable option to afford college; without them, higher education might be out of reach altogether. However, these young borrowers often do not fully grasp the magnitude of the debt they are accumulating, particularly the impact of interest over time. While the principal amount borrowed might seem manageable, the interest that accrues can multiply the debt far beyond the original sum, creating a heavy financial load that becomes increasingly difficult to repay.  The growing interest on student loans is a significant problem because it traps borrowers in a cycle of debt. As interest accumulates, graduates may find themselves owing much more than they initially borrowed, making it challenging to make meaningful progress toward paying off their loans. At the same time, many recent graduates face numerous other financial responsibilities. After finishing college, they often move out on their own and must cover essential living expenses such as rent, utilities, groceries, and transportation. These monthly costs can strain their budgets, leaving little room to address substantial student loan payments.  Given these circumstances, the federal government should absolutely expand student loan forgiveness programs. Forgiveness initiatives can alleviate the crushing financial pressure on young adults just starting their careers and lives independently. By reducing or eliminating burdensome debt, these programs would not only help individuals achieve financial stability but also stimulate the economy by enabling borrowers to invest in their futures—whether through buying homes, starting businesses, or continuing education. Addressing the student debt crisis through broader forgiveness is a necessary step to support millions of Americans and promote a more equitable society.

However, when it comes to public schools, the question arises whether these devices should be banned during the school day or allowed in a limited capacity for learning and emergencies. Public schools should implement a ban on smartphone use throughout the entire school day, including lunch and afternoon breaks. This policy would encourage students to focus fully on their education and foster genuine social interactions.  Firstly, school is not merely a place to absorb academic content; it is a vital environment where students learn valuable life skills. Beyond textbooks and exams, school experiences help young people develop empathy, communication abilities, and an openness to diverse perspectives. These social skills are cultivated through face-to-face interaction, which smartphones tend to hinder. When students are constantly distracted by their screens, they miss out on the opportunity to engage naturally with peers, weakening social bonds and the development of important interpersonal skills.  Moreover, the presence of smartphones often disrupts concentration in classrooms, diverting attention from lessons to notifications, games, or social media. A ban would ensure that students remain focused on the material being taught, thereby improving academic outcomes and creating a more conducive learning environment.  Some worry that banning smartphones might pose safety concerns, particularly in emergencies. However, this issue can be addressed effectively. Parents and carers can always contact the school directly if an urgent situation arises. Schools should establish clear protocols and communication channels to handle such calls promptly, ensuring that students remain safe without needing personal phones.

5d7a1fce27fb8a000196993e,3,b1,"Genetic editing is one of the toughest moral questions we face in the field of medicine going forward. Whilst the potential to prevent diseases is something that is undeniably positive, the danger is that once we cross the moral boundary of genetic editing in the womb it will lead to less ethical uses. Should it be used to choose characteristics for an unborn baby? That would begin to heavily impact human diversity and could be used for pre-emptive ethnic cleansing. The concern, therefore, is not the treatment of disease, but the further consequences of opening Pandora's Box. We also have to question the extent to which we want to further extend human lifespans, something which is already putting enormous pressure on economies and health systems worldwide. ",,"Genetic editing represents one of the most challenging ethical dilemmas in modern medicine. On one hand, the ability to modify the genes of unborn children holds immense promise for eradicating hereditary diseases and improving quality of life. On the other hand, it raises profound moral questions about the limits of human intervention and the potential consequences of altering the natural course of human development.  The undeniable benefit of genetic editing lies in its capacity to prevent debilitating illnesses before birth. Conditions such as cystic fibrosis, sickle cell anemia, and Huntington’s disease could potentially be eliminated, sparing countless individuals from suffering and reducing the burden on healthcare systems. From this perspective, allowing parents the right to genetically edit their unborn children to prevent disease seems not only reasonable but ethically imperative.  However, the concern extends far beyond disease prevention. Once genetic editing in the womb becomes commonplace, society risks crossing a moral boundary that could lead to far less ethical uses. The ability to choose specific physical traits, intelligence levels, or other characteristics may soon follow, eroding the natural diversity that defines humanity. Such practices could even pave the way for pre-emptive ethnic cleansing, where genetic modifications are employed to diminish or eliminate certain cultural or ethnic traits, leading to homogenization rather than diversity.  Moreover, these possibilities raise broader questions about the implications for human lifespans and societal structures. Extending life artificially already places considerable strain on economies and healthcare resources globally. Further genetic interventions could exacerbate these pressures, creating challenges that we are not yet equipped to manage.  In conclusion, while the potential to prevent disease through genetic editing is a compelling justification for its use, the broader ethical and societal consequences are deeply troubling. To preserve natural human diversity and avoid the dangerous precedent of unchecked genetic manipulation, it is crucial to approach this technology with caution, if not outright restriction.

Conclusion: Summarise.",,"The possibility of genetically editing unborn children to prevent diseases raises profound ethical and practical questions. Should parents have the right to intervene at such a fundamental level to spare their children from life-changing genetic conditions, or should society ban genetic modifications to preserve natural human diversity? Both perspectives offer compelling arguments that must be carefully weighed.  On one hand, the potential benefits of genetic editing are considerable. If parents could prevent their child from inheriting a debilitating genetic disease, they might give them a healthier start in life, free from certain suffering or limitations. This proactive approach focuses on prevention rather than treatment, which could improve the child's quality of life significantly. Moreover, reducing the occurrence of genetic diseases could lessen the burden on healthcare systems by lowering the demand for lifelong medical care and interventions. From a moral standpoint, many might argue that it is the responsible and compassionate choice to use available technology to prevent avoidable suffering. In this sense, genetic editing could be seen as a step forward in parental care and medical progress.  However, the practice of genetic modifications also raises serious concerns. The question of accessibility is paramount: would these technologies be available to all, or only to wealthy families able to afford them? Such disparities could deepen social inequalities. Additionally, the ethical boundaries between preventing disease and selecting non-medical traits such as hair or eye color are blurred, risking a slippery slope towards eugenics. Society would need clear, enforceable regulations to distinguish legitimate health-related interventions from enhancements driven by personal or aesthetic preferences. Furthermore, there are philosophical arguments about preserving natural human diversity and accepting the randomness inherent in human genetics. The prospect of “designing” humans could diminish acceptance of differences and reduce genetic variation in the population.  In conclusion, while genetic editing offers hopeful possibilities for preventing suffering and improving health, it also introduces complex ethical dilemmas and potential social risks. A balanced approach that carefully regulates its use, emphasizing disease prevention while guarding against misuse and inequality, is essential as this technology advances. Society must navigate these challenges thoughtfully to ensure that scientific progress benefits all without compromising core human values.","Should parents have the right to intervene to spare their children from potentially life-changing genetic conditions, or should society as a whole ban genetic modifications to preserve natural human diversity?

Now, science has even ventured to approach the idea that parents can genetically edit their unborn children. How can that idea even be considered? We are mere human beings. We are not God. God does not make mistakes. When he creates a child it is perfect, even if it has disabilities. The fact that any child should be made to feel that they are ""imperfect"", is inconceivable.   Just because we have the ability to do something does not mean we should do it. I cannot even imagine what long term damage could be done by experimenting on children like guinea pigs. They have tried cloning animals and that didn't work out to well. If we are editing a child's genetics, are we not trying to make a clone of the perfect child.  What about the children who were not edited genetically? How will they compare themselves to the perfect specimen? I think that science and technology are amazing in most areas of our lives and our jobs, but I think when it comes to trying to play ""God"", they cross the line into something that is sinister. It is understandable that parents would want to protect their children from diseases but turning them into lab rats is not the way to do it. The birth of a child is such a wonder to behold, and it's even more amazing to see each unique feature that comes only from the hand of God.  "

Hybrid schedules offer compromise structured office days with remote flexibility   Conclusion: Employer should prioritize f ",,"The debate over whether large employers should require workers to return to the office several days a week or allow fully remote schedules by default has become increasingly relevant in today’s evolving work landscape. While remote work offers undeniable flexibility, compelling reasons suggest that a structured return to the office can be more beneficial for companies and employees alike.  One of the main advantages of office work is the enhancement of teamwork. Being physically present fosters clearer communication and more spontaneous collaboration, which are often limited in virtual settings. Face-to-face interactions help build stronger relationships among colleagues, contributing to a robust company culture that can be difficult to cultivate remotely. Additionally, supervision and feedback become more straightforward in an office environment, enabling managers to support employees effectively and ensure productivity.  That said, remote work presents certain challenges. It can hinder teamwork by reducing informal interactions and shared experiences that often spark creativity and cohesion. For some employees, working from home may also lead to feelings of isolation and disengagement, negatively impacting morale. Conversely, insistence on full-time office work might lower job satisfaction for those who value flexibility, potentially affecting retention.  A promising middle ground is the hybrid schedule, which combines the benefits of both approaches. By designating specific days for in-office attendance, companies can maintain structured opportunities for collaboration and cultural reinforcement while allowing employees the flexibility to work remotely on other days. This balance can optimize productivity and employee well-being alike.  In conclusion, large employers should prioritize a hybrid model that requires workers to return to the office several days a week while preserving remote work options. This approach leverages the advantages of in-person interaction and supervision without sacrificing the flexibility that modern employees increasingly value. Ultimately, a balanced strategy supports stronger teamwork, clearer communication, and a healthier company culture.","The question of whether big companies should make workers to return to the office several days a week or allow fully remote schedules by default has gained significant attention in recent years. As companies navigate the evolving landscape of work, Both options have pros and cons, but a mix of both called hybrid schedule might be the best solution. Ultimately, requiring some in-office presence fosters stronger teamwork and communication, stronger company culture, and easier supervision while also allowing flexibility through hybrid schedules.  One of the primary advantages of office work is the enhancement of teamwork. Being physically present facilitates clearer communication and enables spontaneous collaboration among colleagues. These interactions often lead to creative problem-solving and quicker decision-making, which can be difficult to replicate fully in a remote setting. Additionally, working in the office contributes to building a stronger company culture, as employees share a collective environment and develop more meaningful relationships. From a managerial perspective, office work also allows for easier supervision and immediate feedback, helping maintain productivity and align goals more effectively.  A goodl middle ground is a hybrid schedule, where employess split their time between the office and home. This way, companies keep the benefits of the in-person teamwork while still offering flexibilty  However, it is important to acknowledge the challenges associated with both remote and office work. Remote work can sometimes reduce the frequency and quality of team interactions, leading to feelings of isolation and disconnection. Conversely, mandating full-time office attendance may lower employee morale among those who value flexibility and work-life balance. Recognizing these trade-offs, many companies have adopted hybrid schedules, which offer a compromise by designating structured office days while permitting remote work on other days. This approach supports teamwork and culture-building without sacrificing the flexibility that employees increasingly desire.  In conclusion, large employers should prioritize a balanced approach by requiring workers to return to the office several days a week while allowing remote work options. Such a strategy harnesses the benefits of in-person collaboration and supervision while honoring employees’ need for flexibility, ultimately fostering a more productive and engaged workforce."

It can also cause air pollution when people inhale the polluted air into their lungs causing  respiratory  disease which will be a threat to their lives. People should be responsible  for their own action depending on what choices  they made and the thing that they use hence they should make wise decisions  on what protects  their environment leaving it healthy.,,"In many cities, the use of gas-powered leaf blowers has become a common practice for maintaining clean and tidy outdoor spaces. However, these machines generate significant noise and air pollution, raising the question of whether cities should ban them or leave equipment choices to homeowners and landscapers. While personal responsibility is important, the negative impacts of gas-powered leaf blowers on public health and the environment suggest that cities should consider restricting their use.  One of the most pressing concerns associated with gas-powered leaf blowers is the excessive noise they produce. The loud operation of these machines can disturb the peace of neighborhoods and cause stress and discomfort to residents. Constant exposure to such noise pollution can have unhealthy effects, including increased blood pressure, sleep disturbances, and reduced overall well-being. In this sense, the noise created by gas blowers is not just a minor inconvenience but a serious public health issue that affects many people in the surrounding environment.  In addition to noise, gas-powered leaf blowers contribute to air pollution by emitting harmful gases and particulate matter. When people inhale polluted air, they risk developing respiratory diseases such as asthma, bronchitis, and other lung conditions. These health risks are especially concerning for vulnerable groups like children, the elderly, and those with preexisting health problems. The pollution caused by gas blowers not only harms individual health but also damages the broader environment, contributing to air quality degradation and climate change.  While it is true that individuals should be responsible for the choices they make regarding the equipment they use, personal responsibility alone may not address the wider community impact. Wise decision-making means recognizing the consequences of one’s actions on others and the environment.

It could change how we see life, reduce human diversity, and created even bigger gaps between the rich and poor. That's why I believe we should now allow the genetic editing of unborn children.  First of all, editing a child's genes before they are born turns life into something that can be designed, like a product.

While prenatal care aims to improve health rather than select traits, gene editing crosses ethical lines by allowing intentional human design beyond therapeutic goals. However, strict ethical guidelines could be established to restrict gene editing solely to preventing serious diseases, avoiding non-medical modifications, but even then these laws could be changed over time and still lead to designer babies. For example, previous technologies like cloning faced strict regulations initially, but loopholes and changing public opinion have led to ethical debates and enforcement difficulties over time. For example, the difficulty in enforcing international agreements on gene editing technologies highlights the risk that some countries might permit broader uses, undermining global ethical standards. This suggests that controlling gene editing solely for medical purposes could become problematic. For example, despite strict laws on drug use, enforcement remains inconsistent worldwide, illustrating how regulations may fail over time.  Another big issue is the loss of genetic diversity.

66640059232bcc6a15b24803,3,b1,"Introduction- What is genetic modification and what are the uses of genetic modification specifically how has it been used in preventing diseases in both children and adults before now  Paragraph 1- Benefits of genetic modification and how can it improve the quality of life in children  Paragraph 2- What are the drawbacks of genetic modification and how can it impact society now and in the future, especially for future unborn children.  Conclusion; Argument against genetic modification",,"Genetic modification refers to the deliberate alteration of an organism’s DNA to achieve desired traits or to eliminate undesirable ones. In the realm of human health, genetic modification has been used to prevent and treat diseases by targeting specific genes responsible for hereditary conditions. Techniques such as gene therapy have shown promise in correcting genetic defects in both children and adults, potentially eradicating diseases like cystic fibrosis, sickle cell anemia, and certain forms of cancer before symptoms even arise. As technology advances, the possibility of editing the genes of unborn children to prevent hereditary diseases has become a topic of intense ethical and scientific debate.  The benefits of genetic modification are significant, particularly in how it can improve the quality of life for children who might otherwise inherit debilitating conditions. By removing or correcting faulty genes in embryos, parents could ensure their children are born free from serious illnesses, reducing suffering and medical costs associated with long-term treatment. This proactive approach could enhance overall health outcomes, increase life expectancy, and allow children to lead fuller, healthier lives. Moreover, genetic modification could potentially eradicate certain genetic diseases from the human population entirely, leading to a future where fewer people are burdened by hereditary conditions.  However, there are substantial drawbacks to consider. Genetic modification raises concerns about the long-term impact on society and natural human diversity. Altering the genetic makeup of unborn children might lead to unforeseen genetic complications that could affect future generations. Furthermore, it could exacerbate social inequalities if such technologies are only accessible to wealthy families, creating a genetic divide between economic classes. There is also the risk of diminishing the natural genetic variation that contributes to human resilience and adaptability, potentially making humanity more vulnerable to new diseases or environmental changes. Ethical concerns also arise around the idea of “designing” human beings, which challenges the principle of accepting and valuing natural human differences.  In conclusion, while genetic modification offers promising benefits in preventing disease, the risks to society and the preservation of natural human diversity are too significant to ignore. Therefore, genetic modifications on unborn children should be banned to maintain ethical standards and protect the integrity of human genetic diversity for future generations.","Genetic modification refers to the deliberate alteration of a person's DNA to achieve desired traits or eliminate undesirable ones.

The benefits of bringing extinct species back far outweigh the guilt humanity may face as a direct result of being the cause for many species extinction. Firstly, it is possible to believe that many ecosystems may benefit from bringing back extinct animals. A first point that is apparent local to me would be an arguement for bringing back the native molf species which originally belonged to the UK. At this time the UK has to physically intervene in what would be a complete food chain, by culling populations of deer, as they do not have a natural predator. It is true that it would be possible to introduce a close relation, likely the Grey wolf, but it is unknown how they would function as a way of controlling the population, by bringing back the native species from extinction, it would likely have a much better outcome. Next, it is possible to conceive that with the path to bringing back now extinct species, that major funding would have to go into medical technologies to help facilitate this process. As a result we are likely to see wide reaching benefits across many other areas that wil directly benefit humans.  It is possible to imagine how reintroducing extinct species may have some unintended consequences. The first which comes to mind would be the possible disruption to now established food chains.

Recent studies have shown that the increase in childhood asthma is directly linked to the quality of our air and we should be doing everything possible to improve air quality.  There are a number of battery powered models on the market that provide viable alternatives that greater reduce the overall environmental impact of leaf blowers.  There is however concern that this will be an extra expense for both homeowners and small businesses at a time when everyone is under financial pressure.  Throwing away existing, working models is seen as a wasteful expense and no without its own environmental impact. There are also concerns around governmental overreach and the lack of man power to actual perform enforcement.  Long term the benefits out weigh the negatives and so the task is to find a manageable solution, that helps negate some of the concerns.  Such a solution would be more ""carrot than stick"" - people would be incentivized to move from gas lead blowers to more environmentally friendly battery powered models with financial rewards, for example money off a new model if they ""turn in"" they old polluting equipment.

668524a1a970340348138c93,4,b2," Point - It is bad for the publics health Evidence -  Not only does the gas powered leaf blower burn the fuel when in use, the fact that it uses a non renewable fossil fuel is also bad for the environment. Explanation - When it is being used it is going to be pumping toxic chemicals into the air. That puts at risk peoples health and could give them long term health problems like lung cancer and asthma. It makes the outsie spaces that they are being used in where there are trees and parks less safe for residents and children playing outside aswell as for the person using it.  Point -Poses a risk to hearing Evidence - They are extremely noisy, and not only can cause the user permanent hearing loss, those around that are exposed to the sound for a prolonged time also are at risk. Explanation - The level of noise pollution stops WFH, has a negative effect on MH  Point - Expensive  Evidence - Crisis of living / extra cost / money businesses and families cant afford Explanation - Cleaner and debris free better for safety than crippling economy  Point - Petrol is better Evidence - More power / Last longer than battery and lighter Explanation - more efficient / less injury / cheaper","Waking up on a weekend morning has a massive difference based on where you reside, with the sound of gas powered leaf blowers cutting many people's lay-in's short yet others only see the clean and peaceful streets after. In this essay we shall discuss the pros and cons of gas powered leaf blowers and their effect on society, the environment and the economy.  Public health is a key concern especially with the use of gas as a fuel for the blowers. Not only does this mean that they are burning a non-renewable fossil fuel which causes significant damage and issues to the environment, but the making and storing of these fuels pump toxic chemicals into the air, causing long term health conditions such as lung cancer and asthma. The blowing itself also sending debris and dust into the air which means that local parks and open spaces used by residents to enjoy the fresh air are now not breathing fresh air in but damaging themselves.  Another key issue with the blowers is the sheer amount of noise they make. It is common that people that use these machines are higher of risk of hearing issues with the amount of decibels they hit but also the local residents feel the impact too with the constant loud noise effecting those who work from home as well as those who are trying to relax, damaging their mental health.  In an ideal world remove the fossil fuel and the noise and have an equally powered product but it is not the case with the blowers. Battery powered ones are less powerful meaning that they are not as efficient as the current ones. The batteries weigh significantly more and are less ergonomic which in turn means the battery powered blowers cause more injury.   As we are currently facing a massive financial crisis, the cost of replacing the units is not affordable for local businesses and many home owners and families.

Not only does this mean that they burn non-renewable fossil fuels that harm the environment, but the making and storing of these fuels pump toxic chemicals into the air, causing long term health conditions such as lung cancer and asthma. The production and storage of fossil fuels for blowers contribute notably to air pollution, releasing volatile organic compounds and particulate matter, which are estimated to account for X% of local smog in urban areas.

In an ideal world, remove the fossil fuel and the noise and have an equally powered product but it is not the case with the blowers. Battery powered ones are less powerful meaning that they are not as efficient as the current ones. According to a report by the EPA, battery-powered blowers have approximately 70-80% of the power output of gas models, affecting their efficiency in heavy-duty tasks. While battery-powered blowers typically have slightly less power, they are sufficient for most residential and light commercial tasks, and ongoing battery technology is continually improving their performance. The batteries weigh significantly more and are less ergonomic which in turn means battery-powered blowers increase the risk of injury.   As we are currently facing a massive financial crisis, the cost of replacing the units is not affordable for local businesses and many home owners and families. Although battery-powered blowers have higher upfront costs, tax incentives and lower maintenance and fuel expenses can make them more cost-effective over time for businesses and homeowners. For example, while battery-powered blowers have a higher initial cost, their lower fuel and maintenance expenses can lead to savings over time. People simply want clean places where they can enjoy and relax."

In a democratic capitalist society, education debt represents a contractual agreement between the borrower and the lender—typically the government or private institutions—and should be honored as agreed upon from the outset. Forgiving such debt through government intervention undermines the principle of personal responsibility and jeopardizes the integrity of financial commitments that underpin the education system and broader economy.  Moreover, relying on government-led redistribution to address education debt is neither sustainable nor equitable. Forgiveness programs effectively shift the financial burden onto taxpayers, many of whom did not attend college or have already repaid their loans. This redistribution is a short-term fix that overlooks the root causes of high education costs and places undue strain on public resources. Instead of broadening loan forgiveness, policymakers should prioritize initiatives that foster economic growth and individual prosperity through improved labor conditions, reduced unemployment, and enhanced innovation.  Addressing education debt requires structural changes that transcend simple forgiveness. For instance, investing in workforce development programs can lower unemployment and help graduates secure higher-paying jobs to repay their debts. Encouraging innovation can create new industries and opportunities, bolstering economic resilience and personal financial stability. Additionally, education powerhouse institutions, which often possess sizable endowments, should bear increased responsibility for their operational sustainability. Requiring such institutions to rely more heavily on their endowments, rather than perpetually driving up tuition fees, would help stabilize education costs and reduce future student debt burdens.

Instead of broadening loan forgiveness, policymakers should prioritize initiatives that foster economic growth and individual prosperity through improved labour conditions, reduced unemployment, and enhanced innovation. This is essential as the looming AI impact will forever shift workplace dynamics. As soon as talk about AI replacing jobs starts, everyone should have their entire education debt written off.

For instance, investing in workforce development programs can lower unemployment and help graduates secure higher-paying jobs to repay their debts. Encouraging innovation can create new industries and opportunities, bolstering economic resilience and personal financial stability. However, the publicly listed companies should first and foremost not be allowed to fire workers in large cohorts due to all sorts of subjective reasonings. Additionally, education powerhouse institutions, which often possess sizable endowments, should bear increased responsibility for their operational sustainability. Requiring such institutions to rely more heavily on their endowments, rather than perpetually driving up tuition fees, would help stabilize education costs and reduce future student debt burdens. They should also be forbidden to meddle with tuition fees and enrolment numbers since apparently education is becoming less and less commercially viable.  In conclusion, rather than broadening student-loan forgiveness programs, the federal government should focus on strengthening economic fundamentals and promoting institutional responsibility.

Banning them would bring quiet to the area and reduce atmospheric pollution too. It is time to move onto newer technologies.,,"Gas-powered leaf blowers have long been a common tool for maintaining yards and public spaces. However, their continued use poses significant problems, primarily due to the noise and pollution they generate. Given these drawbacks, cities should consider banning gas-powered leaf blowers to promote a quieter and cleaner environment.  One of the most glaring issues with gas-powered leaf blowers is the excessive noise they produce. The loud, often incessant hum can disrupt the peace of residential neighborhoods, making it difficult for residents to enjoy their own outdoor space or even the indoors when windows are open. Many users of these devices seem inconsiderate of their neighbors, operating them early in the morning or late into the evening without regard for the disturbance caused. This noise pollution not only affects human well-being but also impacts local wildlife, disturbing natural habitats.  In addition to noise, gas-powered leaf blowers are notorious for their environmental impact. They emit harmful pollutants, including carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter, contributing to poor air quality and climate change. Unlike electric or battery-operated models, gas blowers rely on fossil fuels, perpetuating reliance on outdated, polluting technology. Fortunately, quieter and cleaner alternatives are readily available on the market today, offering comparable performance without the negative side effects.  The continued use of gas-powered leaf blowers often reflects a resistance to adopting new technologies by a particular segment of users who prefer the familiarity or power of these older machines. However, it is imperative to prioritize community health and environmental well-being over convenience. By banning gas-powered leaf blowers, cities can significantly reduce noise pollution and decrease atmospheric emissions, fostering a more pleasant and sustainable living environment.  In conclusion, the drawbacks of gas-powered leaf blowers far outweigh their benefits.

666fb6f24d1c14f333eb4a0a,4,b1,1. Introduction  2. Quality of Life - Effect on child and parents. - Future considerations related to physical and emotional well-being  3. Financial Implications of Care - Direct cost of parents to pay for care - Impact on the healthcare system as a whole  4. Morality vs Emotion - Fundamental reasons for having children - Ethical implications of genetic modifications - Personal right versus legal considerations.  5. Conclusion,"The topic of having the right to genetically edit their unborn child's DNA to prevent diseases is controversial.  The topic questions core beliefs of both humanity and ethics.  Ultimately, I believe a parent should be allowed the option to genetically edit their child's DNA in order to prevent terminal or debilitating diseases in order to maintain a quality of life for both the parents and child.  The first consideration revolves around quality of life.  This encompasses both the life of the parents and child.  For a parent to have to bear the financial, physical and emotional effects of caring for a child with a disease is unfathomable.  It's an added strain on the the already taxing duties that come with a healthy child, let alone one who is sick or crippled.  For the child, living with such diseases adds another element of difficulty on a physical, emotional and social level.  Children with diseases are often ridiculed or treated differently by their peers.  That the means are available to prevent these things from happening would be a relief for both parents and children alike.  The second point to mention are the financial costs of caring for a child with a disease.  These are ongoing costs that often require years and years of treatment.  In some cases, the treatments can be for the duration of the child's life.  Given that they have a disease limits their future earning potential. When taking these things into account, it would be a difficult journey for all involved.  Additionally, for parents who cannot afford treatment, often times it's the tax payers than need to fund care.  This places a burden on society which can be solved before it begins.  Lastly and perhaps most importantly is the conflict between what is morally right and what is emotionally right.  I believe that when a couple brings a child into this world, their goal is to give the child the best life possible.  It's a natural human desire.  To deny them the right to that, I would argue, is immoral in itself.  Certainly gene modification can be abused so I support regulations that dictate what is and is not acceptable.  It would only be allowed to prevent terminal or debilitating diseases and not simply to make a child taller, better looking or have blue eyes.  In conclusion, while there are valid arguments for both points of view, I believe it comes down to the parents and child.  Society can judge, but unless they walk in the shoes of those who have to live that life, they have no right to determine what can and cannot be done.  Every family should have the right or the ability to ensure they live a happy and productive life by any means available.  ",,"The topic of having the right to genetically edit their unborn child's DNA to prevent diseases is controversial.  The topic challenges fundamental ethical and human values.  Ultimately, I believe a parent should be allowed the option to genetically edit their child's DNA in order to prevent terminal or debilitating diseases in order to maintain a quality of life for both the parents and child.  The first consideration revolves around quality of life.  This encompasses both the life of the parents and child.  For a parent to have to bear the financial, physical and emotional effects of caring for a child with a disease is unfathomable.  It adds to the already challenging responsibilities of raising a healthy child, let alone one who is sick or crippled.  For the child, living with such diseases adds another element of difficulty on a physical, emotional and social level.  Children with diseases are often ridiculed or treated differently by their peers.  Having the means available to prevent these problems would be a relief for both parents and children alike.  The second point to mention are the financial costs of caring for a child with a disease.  These are ongoing costs that often require years and years of treatment.  In some cases, the treatments can be for the duration of the child's life.  Given that they have a disease limits their future earning potential. Research has shown that individuals with chronic illnesses often experience higher unemployment rates and earn on average 20-30% less than their healthy peers. When taking these things into account, it would be a difficult journey for all involved.  Additionally, for parents who cannot afford treatment, often times it's the taxpayers who need to fund care.

To deny them the right to that, I would argue, is immoral in itself.  Certainly gene modification can be abused so I support regulations that dictate what is and is not acceptable. Critics argue that genetic editing could lead to unforeseen health risks or exacerbate social inequalities. However, with strict regulations limiting use to preventing serious diseases, these risks can be minimized while promoting well-being. For example, regulatory bodies could mandate extensive safety trials and restrict genetic editing to well-defined medical conditions, ensuring equitable access to prevent social disparities.  Genetic editing should only be permitted to prevent terminal or debilitating diseases and not simply to make a child taller, better looking or have blue eyes.  In conclusion, while there are valid arguments for both points of view, I believe it comes down to the parents and child.

In-person days enhance collaboration and team cohesion Increases employee well-being and job satisfaction.   Balance increases productivity and employee morale Enhances productivity through flexible work environment.   Conclusion: Hybrid work best meets both company and worker needs Conclusion: Prioritizing hybrid work best supports efficiency and employee health.  ,"2020 has been historic to the least. We were thrown into a new world. A new way of living, socializing, and working. It wasn't a choice, it was a safety mandate. Work from home came as a direct adjustment to the rapid spread of the coronavirus, but maybe it just sped up the inevitable direciton the world was heading to. The classic 8 to 5 working hours and 5 day work week has been around for a very long time. But it is built around the technology and needs of an old time. Redesigning the workign week was a conversation that we should've had in 2000 with the internet boom & the ability to communicate when not colocated. But it didn't. Corporations were able to silently maintain taking 5 days of our 7 day week, and 50 weeks of our 52 week year, for almost all our good years, until we were no longer good to use.  It's wild that we needed a global pandemic to have a conversation that should've happened 25 years ago when the technology enabled an equally productive work life, while finally getting a bit more space and time for the personal life. The data doesn't lie. Since adjusting to this hybrid norm after COVID died down, the numbers and sentiment doesn't lie. Companies didn't report massive declines in productivity, they continued to grow in line with the economy and their projections. But there was a noticeable change in employees production. Parents saved money because they didn't have to pay for daycare or a sitter. They picked up hobbies with the time they had saved from not commenting. They exercised, socialized, and were generally happier. That didn't come at the expense of work time, that came out of the commute, and nonproductive time during work hours.

Your favourite English teacher perhaps is exploring the motivations of Iago or Jay Gatsby, a lesson to which you gave full concentration, one in which you may have been able to hear a pin drop, because it was so engaging. One which imbued you with a lifelong love of reading. Would such concentration be possible in a present-day classroom with social media notifications pinging constantly on your smartphone?  The answer is likely, no.  In short, while the wonderful contraptions in our pocket have revolutionised life over the past 20 years or so, the human user was not really prepared the consequences. The reality is that we can access the news, sports, latest gossip, favourite music and video games at any time, whereas previously this really was not possible for the average school pupil.

Indeed, someone who is likely on the other side of the world?  It is great that the world can be lightening fast, but at times it is vital to slow it right down so we can concentrate deeply, without distraction, and make sure we understand and respond optimally.    After all, if students need to access technology, there are school laptops they can access as required! However, school laptops may not be as readily available or convenient for all students, and smartphones often play unique roles in communication and learning outside structured settings.  If so, keep the cellphones at the front of the class in a box for use as required.   "

Smartphones often distract students by diverting their attention from lessons to social media or messaging apps, which interrupts cognitive focus and reduces retention of information. While many students use smartphones for social interaction, this often detracts from learning rather than supports it. For example, texting or browsing social media during lessons interrupts focus. Research shows that students using smartphones during class score lower on tests and have reduced attention spans compared to those without phones. For example, a 2019 study published in the Journal of Educational Psychology found that students distracted by smartphones scored 15% lower on standardized tests.

5d1e2045a37a4d001a1fc2cb,1,a1,"I think allowing limited use of someone's smartphone is the smartest way to go at it. As I believe everyone should have their smartphone in case of emergencies that could happen in their personal life. I think using it for learning should only be limited, unless it's absolutely required for a smartphone to be needed. There's enough argument and valid reasons why banning smartphones in school is a understandable route. But I believe that smartphones shouldn't be banned, but only allowed for limited use","First, I think the argument on banning smartphones continues to become a bigger topic each year in the education system. I don't believe in banning smartphones altogether, because of possible emergencies that could happen in someone's life, or someone needing to immediately contact. I think allowing someone limited use of their smartphone through the day is the better route to take. As It helps someone remain focused on learning in classes, becoming determined to finish school work, learning more instead of being on social media in nearly every class, and wasting the entire day away being uninformed of each school topic. When I was a student in my school days, I would say I was a student that knew when to stay focused towards working on assignments, learning or asking for help with teachers on something I was confused over. I think with this current generation, students are not Interested in learning as often, and probably believes that learning the proper way is a waste of time; due to different services that helps students cheat their way of passing a class. Now I understand this is not the case of every student, but the past arguments and even data would show the low data test scores from many states, and how this affects not only the state but their school systems. I believe that something needs to be developed, that helps students remain effective in learning properly at school, without having to rely on their smartphone for social media or anything irrelevant. Banning smartphones altogether will not help a public school's case, It will only bring controversy, criticism towards everyone in charge, and just be an overall bad experience. Allowing limited use, with proper acceptations is the best way to go with smartphones during a school day. It likely helps every student feel relaxed, and wanting to get the job done in learning.",,"I personally believe that banning smartphones completely is not the answer to help reduce a student's smartphone use. Allowing limited use with a few exceptions is the correct way to go towards helping a student with their learning, and school day.

With the current generation of students, many (not all) doesn't seem interested in learning the material to help them graduate. And there's a number of reasons why there's a valid argument with many of the school systems in different states.     I would say that banning smartphones completely throughout the day is not the answer. Emergencies happen, family issues could happen, and a student should have the right to be able to answer their smartphone, and leave (with permission) if something happened. As banning smartphones could be looked down up the school, the state's school district, administrators, teachers etc. It could possibly even bring out arguments that favors smartphones use throughout the entire day for school.

Imagine the weight of owing tens of thousands of dollars for education—education that was supposed to open doors—but instead, it shackles individuals to a lifetime of payments and worry. Broadening federal student-loan forgiveness programs is not just an act of financial relief; it’s a necessary step toward restoring hope and opportunity for so many hardworking people.  Currently, over 45 million Americans carry student loan debt totaling more than $1.7 trillion. Many borrowers face staggering interest rates, often between 7-8%, causing monthly payments to barely touch the principal balance. For example, a personal experience highlights this struggle: despite consistent payments, the bulk of the money goes toward interest, leaving the original loan amount nearly intact. This scenario makes it nearly impossible to clear debt within a reasonable timeframe, freezing borrowers in financial limbo.  Expanding forgiveness programs would inject more disposable income into the economy. Freed from overwhelming monthly payments, borrowers could invest in homes, start businesses, or save for the future—activities that stimulate economic growth. Furthermore, easing the debt burden would encourage more students to pursue higher education without the looming fear of unmanageable debt after graduation.  Student loan debt also exacerbates inequality by placing higher education out of reach for many lower-income and minority students. High costs and steep loans effectively discriminate against those who cannot afford upfront payment or do not have family financial support, perpetuating cycles of poverty and limiting social mobility.

It is unreasonable to expect children to easily do something that is difficult for many adults. Yet rules concerning phone use in school are difficult to enforce. Phones are small and easy to hide. Teachers would easily miss phone use in class. Setting limits on phone use in class is not enough. The easiest way to keep these distractions away from kids is to keep the phones out of the classroom.       Smartphones are amazing pieces of technology that allow for greater connectivity and provide many beneficial opportunities. However, in the classroom smartphones provide little to no benefit, and a great many downsides. Banning smartphones in schools is the easiest way to address the problems these devices pose.       "

End with a powerful line about why that's a cataclysmic (and potentially exceptional) mistake. - focus on the well-fare of these new creatures - they are not dinosaurs, they are new animals - discuss the terrible effects it could have on the environment - the unpredictability of nature and the inability to actually control it  - how different the world is now from when the dinosaurs were alive - scientists simply can't tell enough about animal behavior from fossils. we can figure out how their bodies may have worked, but there is no way to understand their behavior and that is inherently dangerous.  - disrupting the natural world by adding genetically cloned animals could pose serious risks to the environment, not just the animals. imagine if they got loose? if they were able to escape confinement, how would we possibly capture a rogue pack of velociraptors, or even a singular apatosaurus. Consider the amount of sedative one of those guys would take!","At some point in our childhood, we've all had to wonder-what would it be like, if dinosaurs still roamed the Earth? While I still walk with the T-Rex and Wolly Mammoth fresh on my mind, I'm here to implore: sometimes things are better of dead, whether it drives our wildest dreams extinct, or not. In recent years, the technology involving genetic engineering has leapt into hyper-drive - and I believe that dinosaurs should be kept in the rocks where they belong.   There are numerous reasons why bringing dinosaurs back from the long-dead would be a catastrophic event - perhaps even risk the extinction for the very men and women who see it done. The problems lie in the very DNA of these ""dinosaurs"". In truth, we wouldn't be bringing back an extinct species at all. We would be creating brand new animals that have never before lived on planet Earth, with the very distant base of a dinosaur's DNA as their muse and inspiration, not their foundation.   These animals would be entirely different from dinosaurs as we understand them - and that's another giant problem with this subject: we do not understand dinosaurs at all. These animals lived when the entire planet had a very different face. Even the very air is no longer the same oxygen rich environment it once was. Recreating these animals with homage to the dinosaur would be the cruelest act mankind has done yet: a dinosaurs body was not meant to live in the conditions we live in now. These creatures would not have any understanding as to who, or even what they are, let alone thrive in such a different environment than what their species experienced all those eras ago.   Similarly, we don't understand the behaviors of thee animals at all. Thee animals would not behave like dinosaurs - they would behave as a brand new specie, without any data or comprehension of their mental, physical, and even emotional needs. Most paleontology still function on the basis of theories, because there's simply no way to understand how an animal behaves by its bones.   Imagine the jeopardy to safety that not only the scientists would face - but the general population. It would be so incredibly dangerous to attempt to contain these animals, let alone display, or medically treat them. Take the monstrous apatosaurus for example - were it to need medical attention, escape confinement, or otherwise cause chaos, how much sedative would it take to bring such an animal safely under containment? How would it be administered without risk to the staff and creatures itself? We cannot feasibly control nature, nor the natural chaos that it fosters.

While I still walk with the T-Rex and Woolly Mammoth fresh on my mind, I'm here to implore: sometimes things are better off dead, whether or not it shatters our wildest dreams. In recent years, the technology involving genetic engineering has leapt into hyper-drive - and I believe that dinosaurs should be kept in the rocks where they belong.   There are numerous reasons why bringing dinosaurs back from the long-dead would be a catastrophic event - perhaps even risk the extinction of the very men and women who see it done. The problems lie in the very DNA of these ""dinosaurs"". In truth, we wouldn't be bringing back an extinct species at all. While complete recreation of original dinosaurs is currently impossible due to DNA degradation, scientists aim to approximate extinct species through close relatives’ genes, as seen in efforts to revive the woolly mammoth using elephant DNA. These attempts show both the potential and limits of genetic engineering. We would be creating brand new animals that have never before lived on planet Earth, with the very distant base of a dinosaur's DNA as their muse and inspiration, not their foundation. Such novel organisms could disrupt current ecosystems, outcompete native species, or introduce unforeseen diseases, raising significant ethical and environmental dilemmas. For example, introducing genetically engineered species with partial ancient DNA could disrupt ecosystems similarly to invasive species like cane toads, which cause unforeseen environmental damage.   These animals would be entirely different from dinosaurs as we understand them - and that's another giant problem with this subject: we do not understand dinosaurs at all. While paleontology has revealed much about dinosaur anatomy, significant gaps remain regarding their behaviors and ecological roles, making full comprehension impossible. Although we know much about dinosaur anatomy and habitats, critical gaps remain in understanding their exact behaviors and environmental needs, complicating efforts to safely reintroduce related species. These animals lived when the entire planet had a very different face. Even the very air is no longer the same oxygen rich environment it once was.

For example, incidents of escaped captive large reptiles or elephants have demonstrated the difficulty and dangers of managing massive creatures in human environments. It would be so incredibly dangerous to attempt to contain these animals, let alone display, or medically treat them. Managing large existing animals like elephants and crocodiles already requires extensive resources and safety protocols, which would likely be even more complex and costly for genetically engineered dinosaurs.

It isn't exactly a hard science to understand employees feel better when they feel their needs are met by their employer. When employees know they're trusted to do the work they're hired for as the adults they are, they're happier, retention is higher, turnover is lower and this essentially breeds a better, healthier and improved work force - without the overarching feeling of being shackled to a work desk, or having the all seeing eye of a boss hovering over your shoulder.   At the very least, hybrid working should be adopted by all office employers as standard, with the option to go fully remote if that's what works for individual employees or teams. "

They are an auditory nuisance, much like car stereos and children playing loudly. We tolerate those, so why not tolerate leaf blowers? For one, gas-powered leaf blowers typically produce noise levels exceeding 90 decibels continuously for 15-30 minutes, whereas car stereos and children’s noise tends to be intermittent and less sustained. Their high-decibel noise significantly disrupts daily life and poses health risks.  Deciding to remove leaves from lawns and landscapes in the fall is a purely cosmetic decision.

The reason why I think it's important that we don't ban these gas power leaf blowers is although yes, minimizing our carbon footprint is important. There are times where these gas powered leaf blowers are needed in times of crisis, especially when there's natural disasters going on. For the average usage, I could understand the argument of there's never gonna be consistently natural disasters hope happening so we can perhaps find a way to balance the usage of leaf blowers from electrical to gas. However, I would say it becomes more expensive and less durable in terms of the equipment being used if we go either the plug routes or a power battery component of a leaf blower versus a gas powered leaf blower. There are ways to also mitigate the sounds as well as the smell of the gas that emits from the leaf blower. There could be a usage, such as using it for earlier in the day before staff comes in or before the city wakes up or businesses start opening up, allowing there to be minimizing interactions.","I think it's important that when it comes to decisions, everyone has their input to improving quality of life. I think when it comes to the autonomy of what is best for families, businesses, and/or other parties it's important that we don't take away a choice. It is not easy for all parties to transition such changes if there is no more gas powered leaf blowers in the switches to battery power leaf blowers. Some of these equipment can be very pricey, as well as can create less efficiency for larger jobs, which could hurt an impact businesses. It also takes away the homeowners ability to have a preference in terms of what they feel is best needed for the job that is required. Especially when there's natural disasters that can happen. I feel that that is itself very crucial in times of whether that has been happening throughout years and years with a certain pattern going on. I also believe that many individuals are unable to just transition to the electrical alternatives. I feel that many individuals and businesses are not updated and our not tech savvy. I also think that there has to be more data so that way businesses can feel that the change can be worth it, especially for the potential of job loss for landscapers who rely on gas equipment which can be a dissatisfaction of homeowners who do hire others or want to do it themselves. Furthermore, gas powered leaf blowers, although noisier can run much longer so when the job is being required, that is very long, there's not going to be an additional need for charging electrical blowers which essentially would make up for the sound that's being used. Ultimately I think that there are alternatives that can work, and I feel that an outright van on gas powered leaf blowers is just not the way.

It is not easy for all parties to transition such changes if there is no more gas powered leaf blowers in the switches to battery power leaf blowers. Some of these equipment can be very pricey, as well as can create less efficiency for larger jobs, which could hurt an impact businesses. It also takes away the homeowners ability to have a preference in terms of what they feel is best needed for the job that is required. Especially when there's natural disasters that can happen. I feel that that is itself very crucial in times of whether that has been happening throughout years and years with a certain pattern going on. I also believe that many individuals are unable to just transition to the electrical alternatives. I feel that many individuals and businesses are not updated and our not tech savvy. I also think that there has to be more data so that way businesses can feel that the change can be worth it, especially for the potential of job loss for landscapers who rely on gas equipment which can be a dissatisfaction of homeowners who do hire others or want to do it themselves. Furthermore, gas powered leaf blowers, although noisier can run much longer so when the job is being required, that is very long, there's not going to be an additional need for charging electrical blowers which essentially would make up for the sound that's being used. Ultimately, I think that there are alternatives that can work, and I feel that an outright van on gas powered leaf blowers is just not the way. I feel that there can be a middle ground in which everyone can find through incentives as well as adapt to new technologies that can fit both parties. It is important that overall the balance between noise reduction, environmental impact, and the autonomy is to be had with an open mind and open ears."

Emergency use and authorised usage for a mobile should be permitted under certain circumstances (health, family emergency or even a school emergency) as the safety and welfare of the student is paramount.  Blanket bans may prevent students from scrolling or interacting with social media but may have other adverse effects like rebellion and more interruptions to the classroom in order to get assistance in the work at hand.  The major danger of allowing unchecked access to mobile usage is having new tools such as AI compose work, in test cheating and unauthorised communication to others in order to gain an advantage.","The use of mobile phones should be allowed in limited and authorised circumstances only to ensure fairness, understanding of work, safety and to prevent excessive disruptions in class which are normally a result of requiring assistance or having to share resources when there are not enough to go around.  I believe all smartphones should be surrendered to the teacher at the beginning of class in order that the students are engaged and ready to work and know what they are required to do.  Smartphones should only be given back if relevant to the lesson OR for the purposes of research and proofing work (just like when we were only allowed to use calculators once we could prove we could do the problem ourselves).  Students with health issues (ie: diabetes) and have health monitoring apps running on their phones should be permitted to use these for this purpose (unless it is practical for the teacher to oversee these).  In an emergency (fire, bomb, attack, shooting etc) mobiles should be available to contact authorities and families as the school does have a duty of care towards the health and safety of students.  Considering many public schools lack sufficient resources for the whole class and many students have to wait their turn or share, mobile phones can assist with being an extra resource by accessing online educational resources and this is one major reason why the use of mobile phones should be permitted for limited use.    If we don't restrict mobile usage in the classroom, the disruption from general usage will be detrimental to the education of not just the students who abuse the privilege, but the class in general.

They reduce focus and learning, rob students of creativity by not allowing their mind to wander, and greatly decrease their socialization with classmates and teachers.  Argument: Loss of focus/attention Argument: Loss of creativity/daydreaming Argument: Decreased socialization Argument: Covert usage Argument: Limited use Counter-argument: Emergencies Summary","Public schools should ban smartphones during the majority of the school day. They reduce focus and learning, rob students of creativity by not allowing their mind to wander, and greatly decrease their socialization with classmates and teachers. They are unnecessary for learning, as the form factor is small with harsh lighting, which could promote eye strain. Any necessary emergency contact can be handled by school administrators with very little delay. Phones could be accessed during breaks for any non-emergencies. Teachers have enough problems keeping students' attention on studies. Constant distraction from their electronic devices makes it difficult to educate, which is the main point of school anyway. But the second-most important part is socialization. When students don't have the time to let their mind wander, they don't have time to be creative. We are losing a generation of artists, authors, musicians, and other creative people. We need a sense of boredom sometimes to let the creative juices flow. This is probably a lesser argument, but it is important none the less. Phones can be a barrier for communication just as much as they can promote it. They best opportunity to make friends is when you are school-aged, and some if those can last for life. If the focus is on your phone, you may miss opportunities to learn about your fellow classmates, and even form friendships. Virtual classrooms of the COVID-19 era showed decreased socialization when all communication and contact was virtual. Phone are completely unnecessary for emergency purposes. Parents should have the number of the school secretary saved in their phones, and can relay any messages to them. Furthermore, they can leave a text to their child's phone for non-emergencies, such as being late to the pick-up line or planning for dinner.

Others have looked into a ban but ultimately decided to leave equipment choices to homeowners and landscapers. What if cities could adopt a hybrid approach that combines a bit of each movement?  There are many benefits of switching from gas-powered to electric lawn equipment. Electric equipment tends to be more environmentally friendly. As it doesn't require fossil fuels to operate, there is minimal air pollution and fewer issues with air quality. Electric equipment, especially leaf blowers, are also much quieter than traditional gas-powered models. This lack of noise pollution can lead to improved quality of life for communities.  While the benefits are many, it is important to consider that a full ban of gas-powered equipment would be a hardship for many who have already invested in it and may not be able to afford the switch. To help alleviate this, cities might consider providing incentives for those who make the switch willingly, and offering buy out programs to help people upgrade their equipment without significant cost to them.  Some ways to gain buy in for the program would also be beneficial, such as building out marketing and change management campaigns. Careful consideration should be given to the timeline for rolling out any changes, and abrupt change with short deadlines can cause resentment and may be damaging to the overall effort.

This essay will dissect these viewpoints and will explore whether parents should have the right to participate in this controversial act at all. This essay argues that while parental rights are important, genetic modification must be carefully regulated to prevent ethical abuses and social harm.   When discussing gene editing one of the first things that comes to mind is the potential to eliminate diseases. Many feel that genetic modification can prevent a child from suffering from debilitating, painful, lifelong diseases. Some even suggest that it is cruel to be made aware that your child might be born with an detrimental illness and not intervene when it is possible to do so. For example, genetic editing has the potential to reduce conditions like cystic fibrosis, though critics warn that unintended consequences and ethical concerns must be addressed. Others feel as though this is a very slippery slope. What could start as a way to reduce harm and banish disease could snowball into what might be considered modern-day eugenics. If people are given tools to eliminate certain genes, it is not difficult to imagine the potential risks that may occur if the technology falls into the wrong hands. Historical instances, such as forced sterilizations tied to eugenics movements, demonstrate how genetic technologies could be exploited unethically.  Overall, while there are many risks, I believe that parents should only be able to do so under very strict regulation and in specific cases. As with anything, excessive use of genetic modification can have negative consequences, so as long as we keep this in mind, parents should retain the right to do what is best for their future child.

Against - ethical issues- morally wrong and goes against nature. -Could lead to unknown and unexpected health problems in the child- risky.  Overall - wrong,The idea of genetically editing your unborn child is quite a far fetched idea.

Genetically editing an unborn child can be seen as a parents right in that they should be able to make this decision for their child just like they would for any other important  factor. Genetic editing can help parents who have serious health conditions that are afraid might be passed on to their child and can therefore help prevent genetic diseases and thereby prevent suffering for the child. This can provide the child with a better future and better quality of life.   On the other hand the subject and practice brings up many ethical questions. It can be seen as being morally wrong. It could lead to unknown and unexpected health issues and future problems for the child as the practice is very risky and raises religious arguments as it interfers and goes against nature.,,"The idea of genetically editing your unborn child is quite a far fetched idea.

For example their genes could be negatively affected and later in life when they have their own children their genes and health could therefore be affected too. The process to edit your childs genes would end up creating a group of designer babies for the rich but for the wrong reasons, for example to edit and impact physical features rather than for health reasons.  Overall I believe the process should be banned as it is morally wrong and goes against the natural order of the world."

5efd22056ec55516587f32a6,3,a1,I think smartphone usage in school is a big distraction which can only negatively affect their learning. I think learning to focus on things especially when they are hard to understand is a key part of school life and smart phones offers kids a easy way to not learn. I think it also forces students to actually talk to each face to face which would improve their social skills. I think their is also an element of competition in schools for everyone to have the most expensive phone and this is unfair on students who can't afford a smartphone and might be looked down on.,,"In today's digital age, the presence of smartphones in schools has become a contentious issue. While some argue for their limited use for educational purposes and emergencies, I firmly believe that public schools should ban smartphones during the school day. The distractions posed by smartphones can significantly hinder students' learning, and their absence can foster better focus, social interaction, and equality among students.  One of the primary reasons to ban smartphones in schools is that they are a major source of distraction. Learning often requires sustained concentration, especially when students are grappling with challenging subjects. Smartphones offer an easy and tempting escape from the difficulty of focusing on lessons. Instead of engaging with the material, students may find themselves scrolling through social media, playing games, or texting friends. This distraction detracts from their ability to absorb new information and develop critical thinking skills, ultimately undermining their educational growth.  Moreover, banning smartphones encourages students to interact face-to-face, which is an essential part of social development. In a world increasingly dominated by digital communication, learning how to effectively communicate and collaborate in person is an invaluable skill. When phones are not an option, students are more likely to engage in meaningful conversations, build friendships, and develop empathy and cooperation. These social skills are crucial not only for success in school but also for personal and professional relationships later in life.  Additionally, the presence of smartphones in schools can exacerbate social inequalities. There is often a visible competition among students to have the latest and most expensive devices. This dynamic can create feelings of exclusion and inferiority among peers who cannot afford such phones, fostering an environment of judgment and anxiety rather than inclusiveness and mutual respect.  In conclusion, banning smartphones in public schools during the school day is beneficial for several important reasons. It helps students focus on their education, promotes better social interaction, and reduces socioeconomic disparities. By removing this distraction, schools can create a more effective and equitable learning environment where all students have the opportunity to succeed.","In today's digital age, the presence of smartphones in schools has become a contentious issue.

Wiping out some student debt might ease the burden for certain borrowers, but it does not address the deeper problems that keep driving students into debt in the first place.   One of the biggest issues is the rising cost of college intuition. Every year, students are expected to pay more for the same degree, often without better job prospects or support. On top of that, many schools face budget cuts and inadequate funding, leaving students to cover more costs on their own. Simply forgiving loans does not help the students who will take out loans next year or the year after that.  A better approach would be to invest in real education reform.

Let's start with the idea of banning smartphones during the school day. The biggest issue that most people would agree on is concentration levels. Young people are hooked on TikTok, but they also text each other and use other apps to communicate, and with developing brains, these things would continue to be distracting to them during their classes. Along with not paying attention to their teacher, the student will also be missing out on gaining key social skills at a crucial time in their growth. And what if there is cyberbullying?

What about not banning smartphones, but just limiting their use in school? While they can be used to help students improve their technical skills or to learn how to access different resources, the main factor here is that they are so important during emergencies. If a terrible incident were to happen at school, students' parents would want to know and the easiest way to do that is for students to message them.

There's also evidence that remote work can have a positive impact on workers' mental health, because sometimes in-person work arrangements can cause conflict and stress  I also think that employers don't have sufficient reason to restrict people from working remote, and I think that this could effectively translate to discrimination against people who would do better with remote work for mental or physical health reasons   In general I think employers should embrace change and new approaches to work, instead of living in the past. If they want to make sure that they're remaining relevant and attracting the best employees, I think providing flexibility is key","There's been a lot of talk around the merits of remote work, and whether the old way of working in-person is better for office workers and other professionals. I believe that remote work is essentially good, because it offers workers a lot more flexibility. This can be crucial for workers who have disabilities, or who are on the autism spectrum. This is the primary reason that remote work should be allowed to continue, because it is the right thing to do by people.  There are other benefits to remote work arrangements too. I think that employers who remain open to offering remote work will often find that they're attracting more applicants, because there's a growing number of people who value flexibility and the comforts of working from home. Allowing people to work from home will help keep employers relevant and competitive in the job market. I also believe that for lots of employees, their productivity would increase if they were allowed to avoid commuting. All of the travel time people spend is draining, and for some people they may show up to work already tired from their commute. In addition, being able to work from home would give people more time to sleep, which inevitably would have a positive impact on their health and productivity.  Finally, I also don't believe that employers have legitimate reasons to force their employees to return to the office. There is not concrete evidence that productivity or morale is improved when people work in the same physical workplace, and in fact there's evidence to the contrary. It's possible that the general push for in-office work is also motivated by the people who own office spaces, because if their properties are not being rented out then they're losing money, and the property values of their buildings are decreased. I don't think this is a legitimate reason to make people come back to offices, though, and I believe the most important thing is that employees have freedom and flexibility in how they work.

The bottom line is that allowing continued access to remote work arrangements is the right thing to do, and I think depriving employees of this arrangement is discriminatory. I recognize that not everyone may agree with that assertion, but there are some employees for which remote work is essential because of health reasons. Potentially, it could also open doors for people who care for children and who cannot be physically present in an office space on a regular basis. Remote work is aligned with the values of accessibility and fairness, and these things resonate strongly with me. But beyond what our values are, there are practical benefits to remote work. It allows employees to perform better, which has direct benefits to their employers. In that way, I think it's a real ""no brainer"" to allow and encourage remote work. I think that opposition to remote work comes mostly from a place of conservatism and a reactivity to new ideas. We should not let people who are stuck repeating the mistakes of the past be the dictators of what is possible now and in the future. "
668a9e53e7690b3b64d48e92,3,b2,i thin the use of leaf blowers is negligible in terms of pollution to motor vehicles in cities which should be the priority in cutting pollution and congestion. The usage of leaf blowers should be left to homeowners and landscapers to make. I believe the clearing of leaves is more beneficial in keeping cities neat and clean from all the debris that could be lying around especially during autumn time.   Homeowners are likely to use them for only a short time to clear patios and paving. Pollution heavy activities like cars and harmful gas emitting factories should be more targeted than activities like leaf blowing where it is less common and usage more unpredictable. The noise may not also be such an issue compared to the hustle and bustle noise levels of a busy city where there could sirens of emergency vehicles and the roar of heavy traffic. All in all I don't see much benefit in banning leaf blowers.,,"In recent years, there has been growing debate over whether cities should ban gas-powered leaf blowers to reduce noise and pollution. While concerns about environmental and noise pollution are valid, I believe that the use of leaf blowers is negligible in comparison to major sources of pollution such as motor vehicles and factories. Therefore, decisions regarding leaf blower usage should be left to homeowners and landscapers rather than enforce an outright ban.  Firstly, leaf blowers contribute only a small fraction of pollution in urban environments. The primary drivers of city pollution and congestion remain cars, trucks, and industrial emissions. These sources produce harmful gases in much larger quantities and have a more significant impact on air quality and public health. Given limited resources, efforts to reduce pollution should prioritize targeting these major contributors. In contrast, gas-powered leaf blowers are used intermittently and typically for brief periods, primarily during seasonal leaf clearing. Their environmental footprint is comparatively minor.  Moreover, leaf blowers serve an important practical purpose in maintaining the cleanliness and aesthetic appeal of neighborhoods, especially during autumn when leaves and other debris accumulate. Homeowners and professional landscapers rely on these tools to quickly clear patios, sidewalks, and streets, enhancing safety and preventing clogged drainage systems. Banning gas-powered leaf blowers could hinder timely upkeep and lead to increased litter and debris in public spaces, detracting from the overall quality of city life.  Regarding noise concerns, although leaf blowers do produce noticeable sound, it is often overshadowed by the constant hustle and bustle of urban life, including the noise from traffic, construction, and emergency vehicles. The intermittent use of leaf blowers does not significantly add to ambient noise levels in most neighborhoods.  In conclusion, while environmental and noise issues related to gas-powered leaf blowers should not be ignored, they are relatively minor compared to other urban pollution sources. The benefits of keeping city streets and yards clean and the limited impact on pollution and noise suggest that equipment choices should remain in the hands of homeowners and landscapers. Instead of banning leaf blowers, efforts should focus on controlling the more significant contributors to urban pollution.","In recent years, there has been growing debate over whether cities should ban gas-powered leaf blowers to reduce noise and pollution. While concerns about environmental and noise impacts are valid, I believe that the use of leaf blowers is not as harmful in terms of pollution compared to major sources like motor vehicles. Therefore, decisions about equipment should be left to homeowners and landscapers, rather than imposing outright bans.  Leaf blowers play a useful role in keeping urban areas clean and tidy especially during autumn when fallen leaves accumulate quickly. Keeping patios, sidewalks, and other outdoor spaces clear of debris helps prevent slippery surfaces and enhances the overall tidiness of neighborhoods. Homeowners typically use leaf blowers for limited periods, such as clearing their private patios or driveways. This infrequent use does not contribute significantly to air pollution or noise disturbances.  When considering pollution, it is important to prioritize more harmful and prevalent sources such as cars, trucks, and industrial activity. Motor vehicles emit vast amounts of greenhouse gases and particulate matter, contributing heavily to urban air quality problems and climate change. In contrast, the pollution generated by gas-powered leaf blowers is comparatively minor and sporadic. Targeting major polluters will yield a greater positive impact on city environments than focusing on leaf blower usage.  Regarding noise, cities are inherently noisy, with the constant hum of traffic, emergency sirens, and construction. While leaf blowers do produce noise, it tends to be intermittent and limited to specific times and locations. This noise is unlikely to be a significant disturbance in the broader context of urban life.  In conclusion, banning gas-powered leaf blowers offers limited benefits in terms of reducing pollution and noise. It is more practical to leave the choice of equipment to homeowners and landscapers while focusing regulatory efforts on major sources of pollution and congestion. Maintaining clean and safe outdoor spaces remains important, and leaf blowers serve as a convenient tool to achieve this goal."

67d3ae4ba9a2595f154f14c7,3,a3,The way we work has drastically changed over the years. Remote work suits many roles and boosts productivity. Mandatory office returns often reflect the previous outdated management styles that we witnessed in the years back where remote work was not a thought for many organizations. Thanks to technology this has changed and most job roles do not require an employee to be physically present so at to be productive.,,"The way we work has undergone a profound transformation over the years, especially with the advent of advanced technology that enables seamless communication and collaboration from virtually anywhere. In light of these changes, a crucial debate has emerged: should large employers require workers to return to the office several days a week, or should they allow fully remote schedules by default? Given the evolving nature of work and the benefits associated with remote arrangements, it is increasingly clear that mandating office presence is an outdated practice that does not align with modern productivity and employee preferences.  Remote work is well-suited to many roles, particularly those that rely heavily on digital tools and independent tasks. Employees who work remotely often report higher levels of job satisfaction and improved work-life balance, which in turn boosts productivity. The absence of daily commutes reduces stress and frees up time for employees to focus on their tasks. Furthermore, remote work allows for a more flexible schedule, enabling people to work when they feel most efficient. This autonomy can lead to greater output and creativity, benefiting both the employee and the employer.  On the other hand, the insistence on mandatory office returns frequently stems from traditional management styles that prioritized physical oversight and face-to-face supervision. These methods were developed at a time when remote work was neither feasible nor common. Today, such approaches may hinder innovation and employee morale, as they fail to recognize the capabilities afforded by current technologies. Most job roles in modern organizations do not require physical presence to ensure productivity, and clinging to old practices can result in unnecessary disruptions and dissatisfaction.  In conclusion, large employers should embrace fully remote schedules by default, allowing employees the flexibility to choose their work environment. This shift not only reflects the realities of contemporary work but also promotes greater productivity and well-being. Mandating a return to the office several days a week is an outdated approach that fails to leverage the advantages enabled by technological advancements and evolving workplace expectations.","The nature of work has dramatically evolved over the years. Driven by advanced technology that enables seamless communication and collaboration from virtually anywhere. In this context. A pressing question arised: should large employers require workers to return to the office several days a week, or should they allow fully remote schedules by default? We must way the advantages of remote work against traditional style of working. It is increasingly clear that mandating office presence is an outdated practice that does not align with modern productivity and employee preferences.  Remote work is well-suited to many roles, particularly those that rely heavily on digital tools and independent tasks. Employees who work remotely often report higher levels of job satisfaction and improved work-life balance, which in turn boosts productivity. The absence of daily commutes reduces stress and frees up time for employees to focus on their tasks. Furthermore, remote work allows for a more flexible schedule, enabling people to work when they feel most efficient. This autonomy can lead to greater output and creativity, benefiting both the employee and the employer.  On the other hand, the insistence on mandatory office returns frequently stems from traditional management styles that prioritized physical oversight and face-to-face supervision. These methods were developed at a time when remote work was neither feasible nor common. Today, such approaches may hinder innovation and employee morale, as they fail to recognize the capabilities afforded by current technologies. Most job roles in modern organizations do not require physical presence to ensure productivity, and clinging to old practices can result in unnecessary disruptions and dissatisfaction.  In conclusion, large employers should embrace fully remote schedules by default, allowing employees the flexibility to choose their work environment. This shift not only reflects the realities of contemporary work but also promotes greater productivity and well-being. Mandating a return to the office several days a week is an outdated approach that fails to leverage the advantages enabled by technological advancements and evolving workplace expectations."

67dd4da2c093609cf5b34756,3,b2,"I think the government should ban the use of gas powered leaf blowers because this will be a great start to reduce and gradually stop noise and massive pollution in cities rather than leaving it in the choices of homeowners and landscapers. Noise and pollution can go a long way, not just reducing destruction but also reducing the damage it can bring or cause to hearing. Also,  I think the government should come in because , when all the responsibility is placed in the hands of homeowners majority of them will or might fail to execute it properly.",,"In recent years, the debate over whether cities should ban gas-powered leaf blowers has gained significant attention. I firmly believe that the government should implement a ban on these devices, as this measure would mark an important step toward reducing both noise and pollution in urban areas. Leaving the choice of equipment to homeowners and landscapers alone is insufficient, given the widespread impact these blowers have on city life.  Gas-powered leaf blowers are notorious for generating excessive noise that disrupts the peace of neighborhoods. The high decibel levels produced by these machines can lead to hearing damage over time and contribute to increased stress among residents. Unlike other household activities, leaf blowing with gas-powered equipment often occurs during early mornings or weekends, times when people expect tranquility. By banning such blowers, cities can ensure a quieter, more comfortable environment for all inhabitants.  Moreover, gas-powered leaf blowers are significant contributors to air pollution. They emit large amounts of carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and volatile organic compounds, which deteriorate air quality and contribute to smog formation. This pollution adversely affects public health, exacerbating respiratory issues such as asthma and bronchitis, particularly in vulnerable populations like children and the elderly. Transitioning away from gas-powered devices towards electric or manual alternatives would substantially improve urban air quality.  While some might argue that homeowners and landscapers should retain the freedom to choose their equipment, relying solely on individual responsibility is problematic. Many homeowners may not fully understand the environmental and health implications or may prioritize convenience over sustainability. Landscapers, driven by efficiency and cost considerations, might continue using harmful gas-powered equipment unless regulations compel them otherwise. Government intervention is necessary to set clear standards that protect the community as a whole.  In conclusion, banning gas-powered leaf blowers is a crucial policy step for cities aiming to reduce noise pollution and improve air quality. Such regulation not only safeguards public health and wellbeing but also fosters a more peaceful living environment. Governments must take responsibility and act decisively rather than leaving critical decisions to individual discretion.","In recent years, the environmental and health impacts of gas-powered leaf blowers have become increasingly apparent, prompting debates over whether cities should ban their use. I firmly believe that governments should implement bans on gas-powered leaf blowers as a crucial step toward reducing noise pollution and air contamination in urban areas, rather than leaving the choice solely to homeowners and landscapers.  First and foremost, gas-powered leaf blowers contribute significantly to noise pollution. The loud, high-pitched noise generated by these machines can be extremely disturbing to residents, disrupting daily life and even causing hearing damage over extended exposure. Unlike electric or battery-powered alternatives, gas blowers often exceed safe noise levels, negatively affecting the quality of life in neighborhoods. By banning these devices, cities can ensure a quieter, more peaceful environment for their inhabitants.  Furthermore, gas-powered leaf blowers emit a troubling amount of air pollutants. The combustion engines release harmful gases such as carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and volatile organic compounds, which contribute to smog formation and respiratory problems. In densely populated urban areas, this kind of pollution exacerbates health risks, particularly for vulnerable groups like children and the elderly. Transitioning away from gas-powered equipment is an effective strategy to reduce these harmful emissions and improve urban air quality.  While some may argue that homeowners and landscapers should be free to choose their equipment, relying solely on individual responsibility is problematic. Many homeowners may lack awareness of the environmental and health consequences, or prioritize convenience and cost over sustainability, resulting in continued widespread use of polluting devices. Government regulations provide a necessary framework to ensure consistent and effective action across communities, promoting public well-being at a broader scale.  In conclusion, banning gas-powered leaf blowers is a sound policy decision that addresses both noise and pollution concerns in cities. Such regulations not only protect residents’ hearing and health but also foster cleaner, quieter neighborhoods. It is imperative for governments to take this step, rather than leaving critical environmental choices exclusively in the hands of homeowners and landscapers."

","In this essay, I will be answering the question, ""Should cities ban gas-powered leaf blowers to reduce noise and air pollution, or leave equipment choices to homeowners and landscapers?"" My answer is simple: Absolutely, unequivocally, yes. Cities should definitely ban gas-powered leaf blowers to reduce noise and pollution.  Before jumping into my reasoning, I do want to note that I am not an expert IN ANY WAY in this field and my opinion should not necessarily be trusted on this topic. However, I am just looking at it from an average citizen's perspective, and my perspective on climate change that the steps that we need to take in order to combat it. There are many things that we can do as a society in order to fight climate change, and if we make small changes in many different areas, then even doing something like eliminating gas powered leaf blowers could help with the fight.   My main reasoning is as follows: Electric leaf blowers can achieve the same goal as the gas-powered leaf blower (landscaping, removing debris, etc.), even if it may be more time consuming, or perhaps more difficult. It is still possible for electric leaf blowers to be used to do the job, even if it is not the most convenient thing in the world. At the end of the day, I think there are certain sacrifices that we as a society need to be able to make in order to improve the status of our environment. Making these changes in order to combat climate change may be time consuming and may require effort, but it is something that I would hope can all agree to do.

My answer, although it may be surprising to some people, is simple: Absolutely, unequivocally, yes. Cities should definitely ban gas-powered leaf blowers to reduce noise and pollution.  First and foremost, it is important to note that research from a variety of environmental organizations shows that gas-powered leaf blowers contribute significantly to air pollution and noise disturbances. Although some people may not deem this an urgent change that needs to be made, my argument is this: there are many things that we can do as a society in order to fight climate change, and if we make small changes in many different areas, then even doing something like eliminating gas-powered leaf blowers could help with the fight.   Additionally, my reasoning is as follows: electric leaf blowers can achieve the same goal as the gas-powered leaf blower (landscaping, removing debris, etc.), even if electric blowers take more time or effort. It is still possible for electric leaf blowers to be used to do the job effectively despite some inconvenience. Making these changes in order to combat climate change may be time-consuming and may require effort, but it is something that I would hope can all agree on. Studies estimate that gas-powered leaf blowers release millions of pounds of pollutants annually, contributing to smog and respiratory issues, making bans a valuable step towards cleaner air; therefore, let's combat this by switching to electric leaf blowers.

Student loans are private contracts between two parties who agreed to certain terms.  Student loans are no different than mortgages or any other type of loan from a financial institution or from another person.  Therefore, if a student-loan forgiveness program exists, then it is only fair to expand such programs to every other kind of personal loan so everyone can benefit from their own mistakes.",,"The federal government’s approach to addressing education debt has been a topic of significant debate in recent years, particularly regarding the expansion of student-loan forgiveness programs. While some advocate for broadening these programs to alleviate the burden on borrowers, the government should not only refrain from expanding such initiatives but should actually reverse course and eliminate student-loan forgiveness programs altogether. The reasoning behind this position is grounded in the nature of student loans as private contracts and the broader implications of selectively forgiving debts.  Student loans are fundamentally private agreements between borrowers and lenders, governed by mutually agreed-upon terms and conditions. These loans are no different from mortgages, auto loans, or personal loans obtained from financial institutions or individuals. When a borrower takes out a student loan, they enter into a contractual obligation to repay the borrowed amount under specified conditions, just as they would with any other type of loan. Forgiving student loans essentially alters the terms of these contracts retroactively, undermining the principle that contracts are to be honored as agreed upon.  Moreover, if the government elects to provide forgiveness for student loans, it sets a precedent that could logically be extended to all other types of personal loans. It would be unjust to forgive one category of debt while forcing others to shoulder the full consequences of their financial decisions. Expanding debt forgiveness solely for education loans creates a disparity, potentially encouraging irresponsible borrowing behaviors and unfairly disadvantaging those who have responsibly repaid their own loans, often for non-educational purposes.  Instead of broadening student-loan forgiveness programs, the federal government should prioritize alternative methods to address education debt. These might include improving financial literacy, promoting affordable education options, and enhancing income-driven repayment plans. Such measures would help borrowers manage their debts responsibly without compromising the integrity of contractual agreements or creating unequal treatment among different types of debt.  In conclusion, student-loan forgiveness programs should not be expanded; rather, they should be eliminated to uphold fairness, maintain contractual integrity, and prevent inequitable treatment among borrowers. The federal government’s focus should shift toward responsible and sustainable solutions that address the root causes of education debt rather than relying on forgiveness that undermines financial accountability.","The federal government’s approach to addressing education debt has been a topic of significant debate in recent years, particularly regarding the expansion of student-loan forgiveness programs.

If a task involves a smartphone, a teacher must place a large amount of trust in their students to complete the task at hand, without being distracted by a myriad of other opportunities that present themselves on a smartphone. Further to this, the rise of online bullying is one of major concern in schools, allowing students to have a level of limited use of a smartphone creates opportunities for these kinds of behaviours to occur, creating a range of issues that will require additional work from the school to resolve.

This could perhaps be solved by smaller class sizes, which is often the case in a private school setting albeit to a lesser degree.   Teachers will often guide and teach their students through demonstration and then allow them the time to complete the set task. If a task involves a smartphone, a teacher must place a large amount of trust in their students to complete the task at hand, without being distracted by a myriad of other opportunities that present themselves on a smartphone. Further to this, the rise of online bullying is one of major concern in schools, allowing students to have limited use of smartphones creates opportunities for these kinds of behaviours to occur, creating a range of issues that will require additional work from the school to resolve. By banning smartphones at schools, you are taking away the opportunity for something to go wrong and allowing a student to immerse themself in their education, free from the distractions of the outside world. While banning smartphones reduces in-class distractions, schools should also implement education on digital responsibility and monitor off-campus use. "

Just do yourself, your neighbours an the planet a favour and pick up the brush instead.",,"Should cities ban gas-powered leaf blowers to reduce noise and pollution, or leave equipment choices to homeowners and landscapers? That is the question many communities are grappling with today. While some may argue for personal choice and convenience, I personally believe that cities should ban gas-powered leaf blowers due to their significant negative impacts on noise levels, air quality, and the environment.  First and foremost, gas-powered leaf blowers are excessively loud. Their noise can be heard over long distances and often disrupts the peace in residential neighborhoods. This constant noise pollution can lead to increased stress, sleep disturbances, and a lower overall quality of life for residents. Unlike quieter manual tools or electric alternatives, gas blowers operate at noise levels that are simply unnecessary, especially in densely populated areas.  In addition to noise concerns, these blowers contribute to pollution. Gas-powered models rely on combustion engines that emit harmful exhaust fumes, including volatile organic compounds and carbon monoxide. These emissions degrade air quality and contribute to environmental problems such as smog and climate change. Considering that leaf blowing is often a routine, small-scale activity, the pollution it causes is entirely avoidable.  Furthermore, the use of gas-powered leaf blowers is unnecessary. Leaves typically do not pose a threat unless they accumulate on sidewalks or footpaths where they might cause slipping hazards. In such cases, a simple broom or brush is sufficient to keep the area clean and safe. Manual methods are quieter, healthier to use, and environmentally friendly, making them a superior choice for leaf management.  Lastly, there are several eco-conscious alternatives available today, including electric and battery-powered leaf blowers. These alternatives operate with significantly lower noise levels and produce zero direct emissions. Promoting their use through bans on gas-powered equipment encourages a shift toward sustainable practices without sacrificing yard maintenance efficiency.  To conclude, I strongly support the abolition of the unnecessary, gas-guzzling, noise-polluting gas-powered leaf blower. For the sake of yourself, your neighbors, and the planet, it is far better to pick up a brush and embrace quieter, cleaner methods of maintaining our outdoor spaces. Cities should take proactive steps to ban these harmful machines and foster healthier, more peaceful communities.","Should cities ban gas-powered leaf blowers to reduce noise and pollution, or leave equipment choices to homeowners and landscapers?

I firmly believe that large employers should not mandate a partial return to office work but instead embrace fully remote schedules as the standard. This approach benefits diverse populations, reduces operational costs, and broadens the talent pool.  First and foremost, fully remote work accommodates populations that face challenges with traditional office environments, such as individuals with disabilities. For many, commuting to and navigating an office can be difficult or even impossible due to physical or health limitations. Remote work removes these barriers, enabling greater inclusion and equal employment opportunities. By allowing remote schedules, employers demonstrate a commitment to diversity and accessibility.  Additionally, remote work presents substantial cost savings for companies. Maintaining large office spaces involves significant expenses, including rent, utilities, cleaning, and maintenance. When employees work from home, companies can reduce or even eliminate these costs, reallocating resources to areas such as technology upgrades or employee benefits. These savings can also support more competitive salaries, further attracting and retaining talent.  Moreover, offering fully remote schedules expands the hiring pool beyond geographic constraints. Employers can recruit skilled professionals from anywhere, increasing the likelihood of finding the best candidates. This flexibility is particularly valuable for workers who need adaptable schedules, such as parents or caregivers. Remote work empowers employees to balance professional and personal responsibilities effectively, enhancing job satisfaction and productivity.  In conclusion, large employers should prioritize fully remote work policies rather than requiring employees to return to the office several days a week. Doing so promotes inclusivity, reduces operational costs, and widens access to talented individuals, creating a more equitable and efficient workforce for the future.","As we increasingly shift towards a world largely spent online, the question of whether employers should require workers to work in an office throughout the week or allow remote scheduling becomes more and more relevant.

This will include points for both permitting and banning the use of smartphones during the day and consider all the evidence that will be gathered.  A conclusion that sums up all the points and offers a recommendation on the issue of smartphone ban in schools during the day.,,"The use of smartphones in public schools has sparked considerable debate among educators, parents, and policymakers. While some advocate for a complete ban on smartphones during the school day, others suggest that limited use for learning purposes and emergencies can be beneficial. This essay will examine both perspectives before concluding with a reasoned recommendation.  Proponents of banning smartphones argue that these devices are a major distraction in the classroom. Students often find themselves tempted to engage with social media, games, or texting instead of focusing on lessons, which negatively impacts academic performance. Additionally, smartphones can facilitate cheating during exams, undermining the integrity of assessments. There are also concerns about cyberbullying and the spread of inappropriate content, which can be exacerbated by unrestricted phone access during school hours. From this viewpoint, a ban would help create a more focused learning environment and promote better social interactions among students.  On the other hand, some argue that smartphones are valuable tools for learning when used responsibly. Many educational apps and resources are accessible via smartphones, allowing students to research information, collaborate on assignments, and engage with interactive content. Moreover, smartphones provide an important safety net during emergencies, enabling students to quickly contact parents or emergency services if needed. Advocates for limited use suggest that schools should implement clear policies that allow phones only for educational activities and urgent communication, balancing benefits with potential drawbacks.  In conclusion, while smartphones present both challenges and opportunities in the school setting, the negative impacts of unrestricted use cannot be ignored. A complete ban during the school day may promote better concentration and reduce distractions, but completely prohibiting phones may also limit access to helpful educational resources and emergency communication.

When compared to larger equipment using gas, the leaf blower will be on the low side. Contrary, it does generate a lot of noise, but so do roadworks. As long as guidelines surrounding noise /work restrictions are adhered to, I see no issue with letting the population choose their own equipment for their landscaping purposes. ",,"The debate over whether cities should ban gas-powered leaf blowers to reduce noise and pollution is a complex one, involving considerations of environmental impact, noise disturbances, and personal choice. While it is undeniable that gas-powered leaf blowers emit pollutants, the extent of their contribution to overall pollution may not justify an outright ban. Leaf blowers use a small amount of fuel compared to larger gasoline-powered equipment such as lawnmowers or construction machinery. Therefore, their emissions represent a relatively minor fraction of urban pollution.  Noise generated by gas-powered leaf blowers is another significant concern. Many residents find the loud, high-pitched whine disruptive, leading to calls for restrictions or bans. However, it is important to recognize that other common urban noises, such as roadworks, construction, and traffic, also contribute substantially to noise pollution. These activities, while often noisy, are tolerated as necessary parts of city life. Similarly, leaf blowers, when used within reasonable hours and guidelines, serve a practical purpose in maintaining yards and public spaces. Adhering to local noise ordinances and time restrictions can help mitigate annoyance caused by leaf blowers without imposing a complete prohibition.  Ultimately, the decision to regulate the use of gas-powered leaf blowers should balance environmental and community concerns with personal freedom. Homeowners and professional landscapers rely on these tools for efficient yard maintenance. Allowing individuals to choose their landscaping equipment, provided they follow established noise and usage guidelines, respects personal choice while minimizing negative impacts. Instead of a total ban, cities might focus on promoting quieter, electric alternatives and enforcing sensible usage rules.  In conclusion, although gas-powered leaf blowers contribute some pollution and noise, their impact is relatively small compared to other urban sources. By enforcing noise restrictions rather than banning these tools outright, cities can reduce disturbance while preserving individual choice in landscaping equipment.

Most people prefer to spend their time at home rather than be in an office environment for many hours a day and this is reflected in the public response from workers. It is hard to argue the case for the return to offices when the recent global pandemic reflected the power and convenience of working from home. People enjoyed the personal freedom and being able to spend more time with their kids or pets or go to their own bathrooms. Remote working can also reduce the expenses of large employers since fewer resources are consumed at the offices. If an employer can reach a good balance of remote work and in-person work for their workers, they can improve both their own performance and the employees performance.  Hybrid and remote schedules are a tool that should stay as an alternative for modern workplaces that are looking for a way to maintain or improve employee morale and potentially save some costs long-term.

While this technology promises remarkable benefits, it also ignites intense ethical debates regarding its implications on human diversity and morality. The question arises: should parents have the right to genetically edit their unborn children to prevent diseases, or should such modifications be banned to preserve natural human diversity? Parents ought to have this right, provided that strict ethical guidelines and regulatory measures are in place, as gene editing can significantly reduce human suffering without compromising genetic diversity.  Gene editing involves modifying an organism’s genetic code to correct mutations or introduce beneficial traits. The CRISPR-Cas9 system, one of the most widely known methods, allows scientists to target and alter specific genes with unprecedented accuracy. Ethically, critics argue that genetic editing could lead to “designer babies,” exacerbate social inequalities, or diminish the natural variation that underpins human evolution. Nonetheless, the potential to prevent debilitating hereditary diseases like cystic fibrosis or sickle cell anemia presents a compelling case for responsible use.  The primary argument in favor of permitting gene editing lies in its ability to prevent suffering and advance preventive healthcare. When parents have the option to eliminate genetic disorders, the resulting individuals enjoy healthier, longer lives free from the burden of inherited conditions. For example, editing out the BRCA gene mutation could drastically reduce the incidence of hereditary breast cancer. Such interventions not only improve quality of life but also reduce healthcare costs and emotional strain on families and society.  Opponents contend that gene editing threatens human genetic diversity and raises profound moral questions about “playing God.” They worry that widespread use could lead to homogenization or discrimination against those with unedited genes. However, with rigorous ethical standards and regulations that restrict editing to serious medical conditions rather than cosmetic traits, these risks can be mitigated. This balance ensures preservation of diversity while harnessing the technology’s life-saving potential.  In conclusion, granting parents the right to genetically edit their unborn children to prevent diseases, under strict ethical and regulatory frameworks, offers a promising path to reducing human suffering. By focusing on genuine medical needs and maintaining oversight, society can embrace the benefits of gene editing without sacrificing the natural genetic diversity that enriches humanity.","Genetic editing, a revolutionary scientific advancement, allows for precise alterations to an individual’s DNA, offering the potential to eliminate hereditary diseases before birth.

",,"Employers should allow fully remote schedules by default. Return to office mandates have become highly debated among working professionals since they are increasing in the years after the pandemic. Despite companies claiming working on-site in the office increases productivity evidence increasingly suggests the opposite is true.   For example, a 2022 study by Stanford University found remote workers to be 13% more productive than their on-site counterparts due to fewer distractions and flexible scheduling. Not only might remote workers be more productive than their on-site colleagues for various reasons, and they may also help the environment by not commuting in via their car or mass transit.   For instance, eliminating a daily 30-minute commute per worker can reduce carbon emissions by approximately 1,500 pounds annually per employee, contributing meaningfully to climate goals. Additionally, they could actually be saving their employers money every year. Companies save thousands annually per employee on office space, utilities, and equipment, as seen in reduced facilities costs reported by major firms during remote work transitions.

Cleaner alternatives: Electric blowers are more efficient, quiet and readily accessible. Opposition: others claim that prohibition is a detriment to small business. Response: Cities can transition to the prohibition and give discounts. Conclusion: The prohibition of gas blowers is healthy and sustainability.",,"Cities Should Ban Gas-Powered Leaf Blowers to Reduce Noise and Pollution  Gas-powered leaf blowers have long been a common tool in maintaining yards and public spaces, yet their negative impacts on communities and the environment are increasingly undeniable. For these reasons, cities should ban gas-powered leaf blowers in favor of cleaner and quieter alternatives to reduce both noise and air pollution.  One of the most significant issues with gas-powered leaf blowers is the extreme noise they generate. These machines produce sound levels that are often above the threshold of safe hearing, not only disrupting the tranquility of neighborhoods but also posing long-term hearing damage risks to the workers who operate them daily. The persistent mechanical roar shatters the peace in residential areas, affecting the quality of life for many.  In addition to noise pollution, gas-powered leaf blowers contribute to air pollution by emitting toxic fumes. These emissions include volatile organic compounds and nitrogen oxides that contribute to smog and climate change. Furthermore, the fumes pose serious health risks such as respiratory problems and increased incidence of asthma among residents, especially in urban areas with frequent use of these machines.  Fortunately, there are cleaner and more efficient alternatives available. Electric leaf blowers have become widely accessible and offer a much quieter operation without the harmful emissions of gas-powered models. With advancements in battery technology, electric blowers are also comparable in power and durability, providing an environmentally friendly replacement that benefits both users and the community.  Opponents argue that banning gas-powered leaf blowers could harm small landscaping businesses reliant on them for efficient work. However, cities can support these businesses through phased transitions, incentives, and discounts on electric equipment. Such measures ensure that small businesses can adapt smoothly while the community achieves greater environmental and health benefits.  In conclusion, the prohibition of gas-powered leaf blowers is a necessary step toward healthier, more sustainable cities. By reducing noise and air pollution and promoting cleaner alternatives, municipalities can protect public health and foster a better quality of life for all residents.","Cities Should Ban Gas-Powered Leaf Blowers to Reduce Noise and Pollution  Leaf blowers that use gas have been a fairly normal garden tool and used in most parks, however, their harmful effects to society and their environs are also becoming evident. Due to these reasons, urban areas must outlaw gas-powered leaf blowers and replace it with a quieter and cleaner alternative to decrease noise, as well as air pollution.  One of the most significant issues with gas-powered leaf blowers is the extreme noise they generate. These machines also make sound that in most cases exceeds the allowed level where people can safely hear thus not only interfering with the silence that most of the neighborhoods enjoy but also exposing the employees who repair and run these machines daily to long time hearing loss. The persistent mechanical roar shatters the peace in residential areas, affecting the quality of life for many.  In addition to noise pollution, gas-powered leaf blowers contribute to air pollution by emitting toxic fumes. These emissions include volatile organic compounds and nitrogen oxides that contribute to smog and climate change. Furthermore, the fumes pose serious health risks such as respiratory problems and increased incidence of asthma among residents, especially in urban areas with frequent use of these machines.  Luckily there are some more efficient and cleaner alternatives. The electric leaf blowers have increasingly become available and they are much quieter and without emission unlike gas powered leaf blowers. As battery technologies are improved, electric blowers are not left behind in both power capability and longevity and act as a gift that satisfies the users whilst benefiting the community due to improvements in air quality..  Opponents argue that banning gas-powered leaf blowers could harm small landscaping businesses reliant on them for efficient work. However, cities can support these businesses through phased transitions, incentives, and discounts on electric equipment. Such measures ensure that small businesses can adapt smoothly while the community achieves greater environmental and health benefits.  In conclusion, the prohibition of gas-powered leaf blowers is a necessary step toward healthier, more sustainable cities. By reducing noise and air pollution and promoting cleaner alternatives, municipalities can protect public health and foster a better quality of life for all residents."

6504c6655c2ae520567f52ff,4,b3,The federal government should prioritize other ways of addressing education debt. With the rising cost of living and the fact most Americans are living longer something needs to be done about student debt. I believe there is a greater need to cancel most of the debt out because most institutions can not guarantee graduates get jobs. Aging with debt is not a pleasurable experience with most jobs offering less than a living wage life is becoming more complicated. I do not agree with not paying back student loans but I think that there should be an option to get rid of it completely ,"Prioritizing education debt should be the federal governments top priority. Every year the price of housing , food, and transportation is going up. Even with the prices steady rising Americans still find a way to pay down their increasing household debt. There should be options to eliminate or reduce student debt through community service or claiming to be excluded from paying  because of extreme hardships. The job market is not showing any gains for those looking for employment. Many families are forced to move into households that are abusive and toxic because of the oppressive weight of student loan debt. Making a case for student loan forgiveness will help reduce depression in borrowers. Some students have reported feeling mentally unwell due to the amount of money that they owe in student debt. How common is this for other countries. That students will take on some much debt to try to fit in only to become seriously ill and unable to work. As a whole the Federal government has the authority  to make significant changes to how we secure and amend the current state of  the nations debt which includes a large portion of student loads. The opportunity to rectify this situation is not only up to  the government but higher education institutions as well, because if students are afraid of accumulating debt they will not go to college. Many parents are opting out of sending their children away to four year institutions because they can not afford even the in state price. That compounded with the fact that the job market is so terrible. In conclusion the Federal government should intervene in the collection process of college debt  and allow for alternative ways to pay it back.

For example, I pay $250 per month towards my federal student loans and only half gets applied to the principal. The rest goes entirely toward interest. This makes it incredibly difficult to see meaningful progress repaying my loans and it forces me to follow a strict budget with minimal spending on leisure products and services outside of my necessities.   Because of the burden of these loans, borrowers often spend less on consumer goods which stifles the economy. Low-income borrowers are particularly impacted, thus perpetuating income inequality and class struggles. Many student loan borrowers can't afford to finish college or choose to forego college all together as a result of their perceived inability to pay back their loans. Without a college education, it is much harder for low-income people to advance enough to move up financially in society.

Failure to adopt this risk based process may result in species being brought back to life which have unanticipated and unintended consequences to the subject animal, humans (such as death or re-extinction), other animals and the environment (such as habitat destruction or change). For instance, the introduction of invasive species like cane toads in Australia has caused significant ecological damage, illustrating the risks of reintroducing species without thorough impact assessment.  This could have potentially disastrous consequences.  For example, ongoing habitat destruction and climate change are evolutionary pressures that could re-endanger revived species if not addressed."

Body Point 2: Remote work can be more productive that sitting in an office IV. Body Point 3: Remote work leads to deeper connections V. Conclusion: Fully remote is the way to go",,"In today’s evolving work landscape, two employees illustrate contrasting experiences: one thrives in a fully remote environment, feeling energized and balanced, while the other dreads the daily commute and rigid office hours, feeling drained and unmotivated. This stark difference highlights an essential question for large employers: should they mandate a return to the office several days a week, or embrace fully remote schedules by default?  First and foremost, happy and healthy workers are the cornerstone of any successful organization. When employees have the flexibility to work remotely, they often experience less stress and better work-life balance. Eliminating the need for commuting reduces exhaustion and frees up valuable time, contributing to improved mental and physical well-being. Happier employees are more engaged, innovative, and loyal, creating a positive feedback loop that benefits both the individual and the company.  Moreover, remote work can boost productivity in ways a traditional office setting might not. Without the distractions of office chatter, impromptu meetings, and frequent interruptions, many remote workers find they can focus more deeply on their tasks. They have greater control over their environment, allowing them to tailor their workspace to suit their preferences and work rhythms. As a result, employees often complete tasks more efficiently and with higher quality.  Contrary to the assumption that remote work hinders teamwork, it can actually foster deeper connections among colleagues. Virtual communication tools encourage clear and intentional exchanges, promoting inclusivity and thoughtful collaboration. Remote teams often rely more on written communication, which leaves room for reflection and clarity. This environment can strengthen relationships and build trust, even if face-to-face interactions are less frequent.  In conclusion, given the benefits to employee well-being, productivity, and interpersonal connections, large employers should default to fully remote work schedules. Embracing remote work supports a happier workforce and a more dynamic, resilient organization in today’s modern world.","Imagine two employees, each experiencing work in different ways: one thrives in a fully remote environment, feeling energized and balanced, while the other dreads the daily commute and rigid office hours, feeling drained and unmotivated. This stark difference highlights an essential question for large employers like Microsoft, Apple, and IBM: should they mandate a return to the office several days a week, or embrace fully remote schedules by default?  First and foremost, happy and healthy workers are the cornerstone of any successful organization. When employees have the flexibility to work remotely, they often experience less stress and better work-life balance. Instead of getting up early for an exhausting and unproductive commute, they can get more rest and spend time in their home office that otherwise would have been spent sitting in traffic. Instead of being forced to sit in an office from 9-5, they get much needed breaks and opportunities to multi-task. The result is more work being done and a greater sense of satisfaction and happiness.   Moreover, remote work can boost productivity in ways a traditional office setting might not. Without the many common office distractions, many remote workers find they can focus more deeply on their tasks. Practically every office has that one employee who walks around interrupting everyone with office gossip, family conversations, and so on. Without such interruptions, productivity goes up. They have greater control over their environment, allowing them to tailor their workspace to suit their preferences and work rhythms. As a result, employees often complete tasks more efficiently and with higher quality.  Contrary to the assumption that remote work hinders teamwork, it can actually foster deeper connections among colleagues. Virtual communication tools encourage clear and intentional exchanges, promoting inclusivity and thoughtful collaboration. Employees are able to meet in their own settings, which can be a topic of conversation and a way to foster deep connections between human beings rather than just temporary officemates. Remote teams often rely more on written communication, which leaves room for reflection and clarity. This environment can strengthen relationships and build trust, even if face-to-face interactions are less frequent.  In conclusion, given the benefits to employee well-being, productivity, and interpersonal connections, large employers should default to fully remote work schedules.

Introduction of extinct species might disrupt the food chain leading to an imbalance of resources that have been relied upon by innumerable species of the modern day. Humans have also evolved without the presence of predators which could pose a much greater threat to basic safety and survival. ,,"The idea of bringing back extinct species such as the woolly mammoth through genetic engineering has sparked much debate. While the prospect of reviving these prehistoric creatures is fascinating, it is important to consider the ecological and safety implications. Extinct animals no longer have a natural place in the modern world ecosystem, and reintroducing them could cause significant disruption.  Ecosystems are delicate networks of species that have evolved and adapted together over long periods. The extinction of certain species has led to a rebalancing of the food chain, with modern animals finding new roles and sources of sustenance. Introducing extinct species like the woolly mammoth could upset this balance, competing with current species for resources such as food, water, and habitat. This competition might lead to the decline or displacement of existing species, causing a ripple effect throughout the ecosystem that could prove harmful overall.  Furthermore, humans have evolved in an environment free of many of the predators and megafauna that once roamed the Earth. Reintroducing large and potentially dangerous animals could pose new threats to human safety. Unlike simple wildlife encounters, these revived species might act unpredictably or aggressively, leading to increased risks in both urban and rural areas.  Additionally, the environment has changed significantly since species like the woolly mammoth roamed the Earth. Climate, vegetation, and landscapes have evolved, rendering former habitats unsuitable. Even with advanced genetic engineering, the chances of successfully sustaining these populations in modern times are questionable.  In conclusion, while the technology to bring back extinct species is impressive, the broader implications suggest we should respect extinction as a natural boundary. Rather than attempting to reverse extinction, efforts should focus on preserving the biodiversity that currently exists and ensuring the health of modern ecosystems. This approach prioritizes ecological balance and human safety over the allure of resurrecting the past.","The idea of bringing back extinct species such as the woolly mammoth through genetic engineering has sparked much debate.

Conclusion      -restate arguments      -Make final points ",,"Cities Should Not Ban Gas-Powered Leaf Blowers  In recent years, there has been growing debate over whether cities should ban gas-powered leaf blowers to reduce noise and pollution. While concerns about environmental impact and noise pollution are valid, cities should not implement such bans. With limited government resources and pressing urban challenges, focusing on leaf blowers diverts attention from far more significant problems faced by communities.  Firstly, banning gas-powered leaf blowers could set a precedent for restricting a wide range of equipment and tools used by homeowners and landscapers. Although leaf blowers may seem like an easy target, future bans might extend to other machines that are essential for property maintenance and business operations. This slippery slope could place unnecessary burdens on citizens and small businesses, potentially harming livelihoods and limiting personal freedoms. It is important to consider whether future restrictions will remain as reasonable as the proposed leaf blower ban.  Secondly, the majority of the public is unlikely to support a ban on gas-powered leaf blowers. Many people rely on these tools for efficient yard maintenance, and landscapers use them as vital equipment for their work. Given the limited capacity of city governments, it makes more sense to concentrate energy and resources on solving larger urban issues such as affordable housing, public safety, and infrastructure improvements rather than regulating relatively minor equipment.  Finally, the actual impact of leaf blowers, though not negligible, is minor compared to other sources of pollution and noise in cities. Gas-powered vehicles, industrial activity, and construction contribute far more heavily to air pollution and noise complaints. Addressing these larger-scale problems would yield more substantial benefits for urban health and quality of life.  In conclusion, while the concerns about gas-powered leaf blowers are understandable, banning them is not the best use of city resources or public attention. The risk of setting restrictive precedents, the limited public support, and the relatively minor impact of leaf blowers all suggest that cities should leave equipment choices to homeowners and landscapers.

","Introduction:  Student loans are provided by private institutions to students entering Universities that don't have the capital required to pay for their studies directly. Students apply for their funding during the University application process and aim to receive loans to cover tuition fees, which are paid to the University to cover course costs, and a maintenance loan, which covers the student's living costs. In the UK, the total student loan per year can reach well over £18,000 depending on the course, with 4-year courses for those from particular regions reaching beyond £50,000 for the total loan.

I currently have a large debt that has grown over time, even though I have worked a full time job since University. This is debilitating and was not something that I was told would happen when I went to university. ",,"Student loan debt has become a significant burden for many young Americans, including myself. Having accumulated substantial debt to finance my Bachelor’s degree, I have firsthand experience with the long-term impact these loans can have on an individual’s future. Therefore, I strongly believe the federal government should broaden student-loan forgiveness programs to provide meaningful relief for borrowers, rather than solely prioritizing other methods of addressing education debt.  When I first decided to pursue higher education, I was optimistic about the opportunity it would open up for me. However, I was not fully aware of how much the loans I took out would affect my financial stability. Despite working full time since graduating, my debt has only grown over time due to accumulating interest. This financial strain has been debilitating, making it challenging to save for important milestones like buying a home, starting a family, or investing in further education. Many students like me enter university with hope and determination but are faced with a harsh reality of overwhelming debt that lingers long after graduation.  Broadening student-loan forgiveness programs would offer essential relief to millions of borrowers struggling under the weight of their educational loans. Forgiveness programs can serve as a lifeline, preventing long-term financial distress and allowing individuals to contribute more actively to the economy. Additionally, expanding these programs sends a message that the government recognizes the challenges faced by borrowers and is willing to take meaningful action to support them.  While other strategies to address education debt, such as lowering tuition costs or increasing financial literacy, are also important, they are long-term solutions that won’t immediately alleviate the struggles faced by current borrowers. Therefore, expanding loan forgiveness programs should be a priority as a practical step to address this urgent issue.  In conclusion, having experienced the debilitating effects of student debt, I firmly support the federal government broadening student-loan forgiveness initiatives. Providing relief to those already burdened by debt is a necessary and compassionate response that can help restore financial stability and foster a brighter future for countless graduates.","Student loan debt has become a significant burden for many young Australians, including myself.

5fcca7bf6a7182b003b32a36,4,b2,"There are many alternative ways to power leaf blowers and some of these options are much better for the environment than using gas power. This article will outline the various pros and cons of using gas powered leaf blowers, discuss possible alternatives and what can be done to move people away from gas powered leaf blowers to those that use alternative forms of power.","Gas powered leaf blowers are bad for the environment and using battery powered would be better due to them having no carbon emissions. Furthermore, gas powered engines are also noisy.  We know that gas powered engines in cars are a major cause of pollution, so it stands to reason that phasing them out and replacing them with other alternatives can benefit the environment. Just as with gas powered cars being noisier than battery powered cars, it is quite evident that this holds for leaf blowers too. Of course, noise from leaf blowers cannot be completely eliminated due to moving parts, but replacing a gas powered engine with a battery powered motor does reduce the amount of noise emitted.  So the argument so far is that battery powered motors are less polluting and quieter than gas powered engines but there are further arguments in favour of battery powered leaf blowers. It is possible to charge the batteries using solar power which will not only reduce pollution further by eschewing the use of electricity as the charging source, but can reduce costs further. There will be upfront costs for the solar charging equipment but modern solar panels that can generate enough wattage to charge batteries are not costly.  There may be concerns from environmentalists that the batteries can be a hazard to the environment when not disposed of correctly. This is indeed a genuine concern due to poisonous lithium inside the batteries. However, research has shown that overall, gas power is more harmful overall when all of this is taken into account. Furthermore, as battery technology improves, there may be a time when the batteries could be made entirely of non poisonous materials.  Given the points made above, it would be a sensible option to completely ban gas powered leaf blowers. There is no argument to support their continued usage and using battery as an alternative has so many advantages.",,"Gas powered leaf blowers are bad for the environment and using battery powered would be better due to them having no carbon emissions. Furthermore, gas powered engines are also noisy, due to them having to ignite the fuel and generating mini explosions within the engine.  We know that gas powered engines in cars are a major cause of pollution, so it stands to reason that phasing them out and replacing them with other alternatives can benefit the environment. Just as with gas powered cars being noisier than battery powered cars, it is quite evident that this holds for leaf blowers too.

Given the points made above, it would be a sensible option to completely ban gas powered leaf blowers. There is no argument to support their continued usage and using battery as an alternative has so many advantages. Manufacturers of gas powered leaf blowers could even take in existing leaf blowers and modify them to be battery powered for a small fee, hence making it easier for owners of such devices to make the transition."

Body 1:   Smartphones are useful for quick and personalised access to educational recources.   Body 2:   Useful for contact with parents or emergencies and offers reassurance to parents.   Body 3:   Can distract from lessons and reduce focus or disguise other usage.   Body 4:   Implement times that can be used and times where contact must go through school or teacher if not reachable.   Conclusion:   Go over question, reccomend balance and common sense. ","The question of whether public schools should ban smartphones or restrict their usage has become increasingly relevant. Smartphones are now apart of daily life for most people and children/students are no different. Schools must now decide how to best manage their impact. While a total ban could reduce distractions, allowing limited use for learning and emergencies offers a soltution that is balanced and applied to common sense.   Of the main benefits of smartphone usage in a limited capacity is the access they could provide to educational recourses.

The rapid uptake of technologies by societies should open up vistas of opportunities in all spheres of life, and most importantly in education. Education policy makers should implement policies that all for limitted use of smartphones in schools for resons that I am going to discuss.  To start with, Smartphones and its embedded softwares support student learning and enhance thier learning experience.

This change not only helped slow the spread of the virus but also transformed how work is done, with many employees and employers adapting quickly to the new normal.  During the remote work period, many employees took advantage of the flexibility to relocate outside of urban areas, seeking more spacious and affordable living arrangements. This shift meant that, for many workers, the traditional daily commute was eliminated, and work became integrated into their home environments. As a result, many companies now face the challenge of maintaining largely empty offices. In response, some employers are pushing for a return to the office several days a week, aiming to revitalize workplace culture, improve collaboration, and maximize the use of their real estate investments.

62c66498e5b6da32be94c7e6,3,a3,"Large employers should allow employees to work fully remote schedules by default, assuming that said duties of these particular jobs can be fully realized from a remote location. Allowing fully remote work for valid positions provide a multitude of benefits in terms of pollution reduction, increased available infrastructure capacity for those that cannot work remotely, and overall improvement to the working conditions for employees whose positions could be fulfilled remotely.   The devaluation of inner city real estate from such a move could be rectified via careful planning and rezoning of streets and neighborhoods to form micro-communities. Which would provide all the necessities for inhabitants within a short drive/walk away, much like how current satellite-towns and suburbs of major cities work but on a smaller and higher-density scale. ",,"In recent years, the debate over whether large employers should require workers to return to the office several days a week or allow fully remote schedules by default has gained significant attention. I firmly believe that employers should permit fully remote work by default, provided that the nature of the job allows employees to perform their duties effectively from a remote location. This approach offers numerous advantages, including reductions in pollution, better utilization of urban infrastructure, and enhanced working conditions for employees.  One of the foremost benefits of adopting remote work policies is the positive environmental impact. Daily commutes contribute significantly to air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. By enabling employees to work from home, the number of vehicles on the road decreases substantially, resulting in cleaner air and a smaller carbon footprint. Additionally, remote work alleviates pressure on public transportation and urban infrastructure. This is particularly advantageous for workers in roles that necessitate physical presence, as it improves access and facility availability where it is most needed.  From the employee perspective, remote work often translates to more flexible and comfortable working conditions, which can increase productivity and job satisfaction. Workers save time and money by avoiding daily commutes and can better balance professional and personal responsibilities. This flexibility can lead to higher retention rates and a healthier workforce overall.  However, a common concern is that widespread remote work could devalue inner-city real estate and disrupt urban economies. This challenge can be addressed through thoughtful urban planning. Cities and municipalities could engage in strategic rezoning to develop micro-communities — compact, mixed-use neighborhoods providing residents with essential amenities within walking or short driving distance. These micro-communities would promote high-density living similar to satellite towns or suburbs but on a smaller scale, revitalizing urban spaces and supporting local economies.  In conclusion, allowing fully remote work by default for eligible jobs is a forward-thinking strategy that benefits the environment, infrastructure, employees, and urban communities. With careful planning and innovative urban design, the potential drawbacks can be mitigated, making remote work a sustainable and desirable standard for large employers.","Recently, the debate over whether large employers should require workers to return to the office several days a week or allow fully-remote schedules by default has gained significant attention.

The debate over whether cities should ban gas-powered leaf blowers to reduce noise and pollution has gained momentum in recent years. While concerns about environmental impact and noise pollution are valid, outright bans on gas-powered leaf blowers are not the ideal solution. Instead, cities should allow homeowners and landscapers the freedom to choose their equipment while implementing sensible regulations to manage usage.  One major advantage of gas-powered leaf blowers is their efficiency. Compared to electric models, gas-powered blowers generally provide more power, enabling users to complete landscaping tasks more quickly. This efficiency is especially important for professional landscapers who handle large properties or commercial spaces where extensive leaf removal is required. Electric leaf blowers, while quieter and cleaner, often lack the capacity and power needed to tackle these larger jobs effectively, making them less practical in many real-world scenarios.  Furthermore, rather than imposing outright bans, cities can adopt a balanced approach by governing the use of gas-powered equipment. This could include setting designated hours during which gas-powered leaf blowers are permitted to operate, restricting sales of the most polluting models, or encouraging the gradual transition to cleaner alternatives through incentives and education. Such regulatory measures allow cities to address noise and pollution concerns while preserving the flexibility for homeowners and landscapers to choose the equipment best suited to their needs.

While expanding student-loan forgiveness programs might seem like a direct solution, it ultimately does not address the root causes of the issue. Instead, the government should prioritize making education more affordable by targeting the cost of schooling itself rather than simply forgiving loans after they accumulate.  Student-loan forgiveness programs provide temporary relief for borrowers by canceling part or all of their debt. However, these programs often act as a band-aid rather than a cure. Forgiving loans does not prevent future students from accumulating similar or even larger debts, especially as tuition fees continue to rise. Moreover, loan forgiveness can be costly for taxpayers and may create an expectation that education costs will be mitigated after the fact, rather than encouraging systemic reform.  A more sustainable and equitable approach is for the government to focus on lowering the upfront cost of education. This could involve increasing direct funding to colleges and universities, helping institutions reduce tuition fees, and investing in programs that make higher education more accessible.

Paragraph 3- Counter-argument ( Home owners should be allowed to work with  their preferences and budget) 5. Concluding statement and call to action. ,"One of the biggest challenges the world is facing today is climate change  and global warming. At the centre of these issues is unsustainable human behaviour, making humans the biggest contributors to climate change. Following the trend,  there have been unprecedented efforts across the world to  undo, and at the very least undo the damage to the environmental, framed under sustainable practices.  Research has established that   insignificant actions such as modifying shopping patterns can prevent further damage. In the same respect, the question of what homeowners and landscapers  can do to prevent further damage arises.  The rationale for this topic is underscored by the fact that equipment such as leaf blowers contribute to noise and air pollution and thus restricting access to the  equipment can help reduce pollution they cause.   Different people have different attitudes to the current trends in pollution. For instance, even though science shows that pollution is an imminent threat, some parties believe that the reports are perhaps exaggerated or that it is too late. Therefore, by banning gas powered leaf blowers, legislators demonstrate a commitment to contribute to the global efforts to reduce  air and noise pollution.  In addition, such legislation standardises approaches to fighting air and noise pollution while providing a legal framework for the same.  We must also take into account the fact that if homeowners and landscapers are given the freedom to choose the equipment they choose, factors such as convenience may overlap with the responsibility to reduce noise and air pollution. Therefore, to deal with stubborn and careless homeowners, a ban is an effective approach that is  simple and that guarantees tangible results. While some may argue that banning such equipment is inconsiderate of  factors such as cost of leaf blowers, it is essential to note that reducing noise and air pollution is a more serious cause that demands immediate attention. Therefore, banning leaf blowers forces homeowners and landscapers to  be part of sustainable lifestyles.

Undoubtedly, these claims further demonstrate that hidden cost of sustainable environmental practices. However, it is essential to note that reducing noise and air pollution is a more serious cause that demands immediate attention. My argument thus also calls unto legislators support policies and projects that avail different equipment alternatives to homeowners and landscapers. "
61310222247b6dcdfd39bddf,3,b3,Student loan forgiveness programs are effective but is not widely distributed. Partial forgiveness distributed more widely would be more effective and fairer. Discuss high income tax and compounded impact of student loan.  Discuss impact of inflation and cost of living on income. These factors cause 'brain drain': the most highly educated people move elsewhere and contribute to a different economy.,,"Student loan debt has become a pervasive challenge in the United States, affecting millions of borrowers and shaping economic prospects for a generation. While the federal government’s current student-loan forgiveness programs provide meaningful relief, their limited scope restricts their overall effectiveness. To address education debt more equitably and broadly, the government should consider partial loan forgiveness distributed more widely rather than focusing exclusively on full forgiveness for a select few.  One critical factor exacerbating the burden of student loans is the compounding nature of debt alongside high-income tax rates. Graduates often face the dual strain of repaying loans with accruing interest while surrendering a sizable portion of their income to taxes. This combination can significantly suppress disposable income and delay important life milestones such as homeownership and family formation. Moreover, the inflationary environment and rising cost of living further diminish the real value of earnings, making it increasingly difficult for borrowers to keep pace with loan repayments or build financial stability. The economic squeeze leaves many struggling to balance debt obligations with everyday expenses.  The consequences of these financial pressures extend beyond individual hardship and contribute to a broader societal challenge known as “brain drain.” Highly educated individuals, burdened by debt and discouraged by stagnant economic opportunities, may choose to relocate to regions or countries with more favorable economic conditions. This migration results in a loss of talent and innovation that could otherwise fuel domestic growth. By expanding student loan forgiveness programs to provide partial relief to a wider population of borrowers, the government can mitigate this brain drain by enhancing economic mobility and incentivizing graduates to contribute their skills to the national economy.  In conclusion, while targeted student-loan forgiveness programs offer benefits, a strategy prioritizing partial forgiveness for a broader base of borrowers would be more effective and fair. Addressing the compounded impact of student loan debt, high taxation, and inflation through widespread relief measures can reduce financial strain and help retain valuable human capital. Broadening forgiveness programs is a crucial step toward creating a more equitable and prosperous future for American workers.","Student loan debt has become a pervasive challenge in the United States, affecting millions of borrowers and shaping economic prospects for a generation.

I was going to college to pursue my career in music education.  I wanted to be a band director, and I was very excited to start this new phase of my life.  Not only did have an enjoyable time in college, but I also was a straight A student that graduated summa cum laude.  I received job offers even before I graduated with my degree.  I accepted my first job in south Georgia and began my career as a band director.  Shortly after graduation, I received a letter in the mail informing me that I would begin paying my student loan debt.  I would be paying approximately $150 a month.  However, I also had the expenses of finding a new place to live, buying furniture and other items for my new place, a deposit to secure this location, new clothes for my job, and much more.  On top of this, the other monthly expenses began such as insurances, rent, utilities, and other standard living expenses.  I had to request a temporary pause on my student loan payments.  Eventually, I started paying a lower amount around $50 a month.  With this type of payment, I would be paying off my student loan for the rest of my life.  I truly questioned the amount of debt incurred through education.  It should be noted that student loan debt could potentially be necessary.  After all, there is a lot of expenses for universities.  The most important of these to ensure that the professors are paid.  However, there are other fees such as money needed to keep the facilities maintained for the students.  For example, game rooms and activity centers require funds.  Universities certainly have reasoning behind these expenses.  However, after students graduated, they are strapped with debt that could last for the rest of their lives.  In fact, if they do not pay this debt, they could face consequences such as wage garnishment or bank levies.  It is difficult for students to pay this amount back being that most will be starting from entry level positions leading to a lower paycheck in addition to all of the expenses that come with a new life and career.  This is a no win situation for many new graduates and relief is needed.  Many have suggested student loan forgiveness programs.  The best part of this is that it can help students who have little income and higher living costs.  Instead of being worried about student loan debt, they can focus on establishing their life, establishing good credit, and being successful.  Students can attend universities and feel rewarded after leaving instead of facing the possibility of wage garnishments if they are not able to pay back their loans.  The government can afford to help with this and it can be very beneficial as noted.  Are there other ways to help students with debt?  One could argue that teaching students about debt and how to pay it back might be helpful.  However, student loan debt is high and hard to pay back.  The only other option would be to encourage students to not take out debt and just pay for their school out of pocket which might not be possible for everyone.

However, even the most financially conscious person can only do so much when they have an entry level position with entry level pay.  The other option would for students to not take any debt at all and simply pay for college out of pocket.  However, this is very difficult considering the high costs each semester.  Forgiving this debt can help students to establish successful careers and live their lives without worries of paying back very high loan debt."
6697cf02d714e7ee3fdedcec,2,a3,"Intro  - happy workers are productive workers   -work/ life balance is better with hybrid working. Flexibility improves work-life balance and reduces commute stress. Employees can choose what suits them best  -productivity  - employers save money on things such as electricity etc  Positives to working in office too. Positives include face to face interaction may foster teamwork and improve interpersonal relationships between colleagues.   With people being different a hybrid approach, with flexibility built in, is the best solution to meet business and employee needs","While obviously the question as to whether large employers should require workers to return to the office several days a week, or allow fully remote schedules by default, differs from employer to employer based on their individual needs, the simple answer is that a hybrid approach allowing both home working and also central, office working is the best solution.   It is known that a happy workforce is a productive workforce. Hybrid working, some time spent in the office and some from home, increases employee happiness by giving them a greater degree of freedom and control over their working life. This both makes them happier during working hours, as things are more likely to be arranged to their preferences, and in turn also happier outside of working hours, on account of their job being more pleasurable for them as one that takes into account their preferences more. Workers can easily save several hours a day on the commute into an office, in many cases to perform tasks which can be done equally as well from the home environment. Similarly, with less workers in a central office, employers also benefit from reduced costs on things such as electricity for heating and lighting, in some cases even being able to downsize offices or sites needed due to a reduced presence of workers in those spaces.   This is not to deny various positives to a central office space in which the whole team is present. For a start, face to face interaction would obviously facilitate easier team working. It also helps with building stronger interpersonal relationships between workers, as they are more likely to talk and bond when sharing a physical space. This in turn further strengthens teamwork as employees are a closer knit unit.   In summary there are both positives and negatives to be considered. With people being wildly different in any large team a hybrid approach is surely the one that fits best for all, in allowing both employer and employee needs, and preferences, to be met, and not forcing strict routines where they are simply not necessary. Further flexibility within such a system allows nuance and different situations to be taken further into account.

67912aea114797f20483bc08,1,b3,"Should the federal government broaden student-loan forgiveness programs or prioritize other ways of addressing education debt?  Thesis: Broadening student-loan forgiveness programs would benefit citizens and the economy by placing money back in the hands of hard working people and reduce inequality  Paragraph 1:   - Student loans are parasitic, society abusing the ambitions of the young  Paragraph 2:  - Student loan debt is enslavement, it locks young people into debt slavery, they cannot afford to live and have no motivation to contribute  Paragraph 3:  - Generational benefits - forgiveness programs enable people to buy homes, start families  Paragraph 4 :  - Forgiveness programs place both money and faith in society back in the hands of the young, which would hugely boost contributions as well as work ethic  Paragraph 5:  - Forgiveness would reduce inequality for all young people   Conclusion","Student loans are a devastating and parasitic force in modern life which feeds on the ambitions of young people who dream of a bright future. They have historically been viewed as a path to success, but in modern times they are nothing more than a trap which is used to enslave our nations use not with chains but with ink. Student loans are exploiting our precious use and placing a monumental and livelihood shattering burden before them before they even begin their adult lives.  Graduates in the modern world enter the workforce and are immediately shackled to their repayment plans that will potentially stretch for the entire duration of their career. Unable to save, invest, or purchase a home, our youth are no longer able to enjoy the freedoms in life that generations before us did.  Forgiveness programs are a reasonable method to ameliorate these issues, producing immediate benefits both for the individual and generationally. Millions could be freed to start families, purchase homes, or branch out and start businesses, all of which are the seed and foundation of a strong society and economy, which benefits everybody.  These programs would not only return money to the young but also faith. The weight of student loans are crushing and demoralizing. We cannot expect young adults to feel motivated to advance their careers or contribute to a society that has clinically abused them. Only when a generation feels that they have a chance at a future will they find the motivation to work for one, when all of their income is taken from them to pay already rich bankers, all hope is lost. These demoralized and demotivated people are not likely to lead, contribute, or innovate.  Finally, forgiveness would reduce inequality across the board. Student loan debt now disproportionately affects the young and vulnerable in our society, which serves nothing more than to amplify the social and economic divides in our society. A young person who is entering the work force demoralized by a massive debt that they cannot repay is not likely to progress into the higher rungs of society, which already appears to be limited to a handful of extremely rich people.  Student loan forgiveness is not only a financial decision but a moral one and an investment in the future of our society. Only by freeing our youth from their debt enslavement will they be able to reach their potential, which would strengthen our economy and reaffirm America as a striving society.

(I don't have them at hand) -The office is full of distractions that are less important. For example, the distraction of a coworker's hours long drunken birthday story is less important than your kid's homework.  -People have independence in how and when they work, and as long as they get the work done the how is less significant. -These reasons and others (if any come to mind) are why corporate employers should implement remote work completely. ","One of the major debates in the workforce these days is whether people should work from home or be mandated for a full return to the office. There is no consensus showing that a return to the office is conducive to better results at work. For one, people relish the independence they can have at home, allowing them to schedule their work around the more important aspects of their life, like parental care. Proponents of in-office mandates often cite distractions as a reason to come into the office, but what's a worse distraction, your coworker Bill droning on and on about his late-night drunken birthday party, or your child's homework? The in-office stalwarts do not know how to prioritize their work-life balance in the same way many of us have to. Furthermore, studies have shown that working from home reduces stress and that businesses that kept it as an option have shown less churn and turnover with time. It turns out people respond positively to being able to set their own schedule and determine how and when they get their work done. From the employer side, office space with exorbitant rents no longer has to be a worry if everyone is working from home. They've already paid their rent! And if you live at home, traffic and transportation are no longer an issue. You're already at work, so no need to sit in that traffic jam and lament the decisions you've made in life. It's for these many reasons that I think working from home is the way of the future when it comes to maintaining increased productivity, promoting a less stressful work environment, and prioritizing the overall wellbeing of ones employees. Being in the office has not proven to do any of these, and the proponents of the mandates know that. They just have rents to pay.

While expanding forgiveness has its merits, a balanced approach that includes targeted forgiveness and innovative educational reforms offers a more sustainable solution.  One effective way for the federal government to address student debt is by providing forgiveness programs tailored to specific professions. For example, forgiving loans for teachers or public servants incentivizes essential careers that contribute directly to society. Similarly, offering debt relief for those who serve the country in the military, forest service, or other government roles acknowledges their dedication and sacrifice. Another promising strategy is the creation of specialized government-run schools that focus on training for critical fields, allowing students to graduate with little or no debt. Such institutions would reduce the burden of education costs while aligning workforce needs with national priorities.  However, broadening student-loan forgiveness on a wide scale raises concerns. Increasing federal forgiveness programs could significantly add to the national debt, exacerbating fiscal challenges. There is also the risk that some individuals might exploit these programs, taking on loans with the intention of having them forgiven without a genuine commitment to their education or career. Moreover, broad forgiveness might promote a dependency mindset, where future students expect debt relief rather than financial responsibility.  Despite these drawbacks, expanding student-loan forgiveness has clear benefits. It can encourage more citizens to pursue higher education, opening paths to professional development and economic mobility. For marginalized communities, forgiveness programs can be a crucial tool in breaking cycles of poverty and creating opportunities previously out of reach. Most importantly, student-loan forgiveness offers hope and relief to millions burdened by debt, fostering a fairer and more accessible education system.  In conclusion, while broad student-loan forgiveness has potential pitfalls, prioritizing targeted forgiveness for specific professions and innovative educational solutions strikes a balance. This approach not only mitigates the risks associated with broad forgiveness but also addresses education debt in a way that benefits individuals and society as a whole.","Student loan debt has become a pressing issue for many Americans, raising the question of whether the federal government should broaden student-loan forgiveness programs or prioritize other ways of addressing education debt. While expanding forgiveness has its merits, a balanced approach that includes targeted forgiveness and innovative educational reforms offers a more sustainable solution.  These decisions are important as they help to ensure that the country has the necessary skills and capabilities needed for the future.  One effective way for the federal government to address student debt is by providing forgiveness programs tailored to specific professions. For example, forgiving loans for teachers or public servants incentivizes essential careers that contribute directly to society. Similarly, offering debt relief for those who serve the country in the military, forest service, or other government roles acknowledges their dedication and sacrifice.  However, broadening student-loan forgiveness raises concerns. Increasing federal forgiveness programs could significantly add to the national debt, exacerbating fiscal challenges. In addition, some individuals might exploit these programs, taking on loans with the intention of having them forgiven without a genuine commitment to their career. Moreover, broad forgiveness might promote a dependency mindset, where future students expect debt relief rather than financial responsibility.  Despite these drawbacks, expanding student-loan forgiveness has clear benefits. It can encourage more citizens to pursue higher education, opening paths to professional development and economic mobility.  Forgiveness programs can be a crucial tool in breaking cycles of poverty and creating opportunities previously out of reach. Student-loan forgiveness also offers hope and relief to millions burdened by debt, leading to a more accessible education system.  In conclusion, while student-loan forgiveness has potential pitfalls, prioritizing targeted forgiveness for specific professions strikes a balance.

60e5fa452bd56bda03990e27,2,b3,"Few would argue the benefits of higher education to the economy, however the question of how to address the economic burden of this education has historically proven somewhat more contentious.   On the one hand, loan forgiveness expands access to education and can stimulate economic growth through increased spending. On other hand, there are contrasting concerns that this forgiveness risks financial strain, and reduces the need for identifying other, more economically sustainable, methods for addressing the issue of mounting student debt. ","The disparity between contrasting, and often incompatible, views on student debt is only compounding by increasing politicisation of the challenges of funding higher education access as they are integrated into broader themes of political discourse. The left will argue that access to this education is an essential part of developing a fair, equal, and egalitarian society with equal opportunities for all, where's the right will argue education being something that is earned not given; being neither a right or a requirement of an economically successful country.   The only question that really needs answering of course is ""what maximises value teconomy?"". If higher education is rarefied the likely downstream consequence would shortages of skills in critical technical areas as well as shortages in other highly skilled sectors such as healthcare and pharmaceuticals. This would lead to an increasing reliance on immigration to bridge the skills gap, whilst risking the very real scenario where the country begins to lag behind others in terms of innovation which ultimately strains local businesses ability to maintain a competitive advantage in the face of foreign imports of both products and labour.

At this point it ceases to become a question of traditional right and left wing socio-political dichotomies and instead becomes the challenge of ensuring the country can continue to maintain it's competitive advantage in the global market.

Cons - camaraderie is lost (more turnover perhaps?), valuable knowledge cannot be imparted easily, offices sitting empty, wider economy suffers","A very common debate over the last five years has been whether large employers should require workers to return to the office several days a week, or allow fully remote schedules by default. Since CoVid-19 hit in 2020, the work landscape has changed significantly.   The lockdown of most countries meant that a significant amount of roles - especially white-collar roles - were done remotely for the duration.

There are confliction opinions on whether there should be fully remote schedules or requirements to work from office per week. For sure, there is a better work/life balance usually for those who are able to work from home - something that the younger generation of worker definitely values; and this can be a way of enticing the top-performing younger recruits. In fact, with the correct work ethic, home workers can actually do more than their allotted hours due to eating lunch at desks/shorter breaks, and not having to rush to catch public transport. As well as this, there is a positive environmental consideration with working from home - less traffic on the roads, less mileage and congestion and public transport is less crowded. A larger company could move to 'hot desking' also downsize offices slightly, a financial positive.  As with any consideration, there are negatives too. A major downside is the lack of camaraderie within a remote office - which could actually lead to retention issues and higher turnover, as there is no reason to worry about 'jumping ship' and leaving for slightly better conditions.

While remote work offers certain conveniences, it is crucial for companies to adopt a hybrid work environment that balances in-office presence with remote flexibility. Requiring employees to come to the office several days a week ensures stronger team connections, preserves company culture, and enhances overall productivity.  One of the primary benefits of a hybrid work model is that it fosters meaningful team interactions. In-person collaboration allows employees to build rapport and trust, which are difficult to replicate through virtual meetings alone. This is especially important for new hires, who rely on one-on-one interactions with colleagues to fully understand a company’s values and integrate smoothly into the workplace. By sharing physical workspace several days a week, employees can participate in spontaneous conversations and informal mentoring that enrich the work experience and strengthen relationships.  Moreover, working from the office tends to boost productivity. While some employees thrive in remote settings, others are easily distracted at home by household responsibilities or a lack of dedicated workspace. The structured environment of an office helps minimize these distractions and encourages focus. Additionally, being physically present can facilitate quicker problem-solving and more efficient communication, which boosts overall work performance.  Finally, having employees return to the office reinforces a sense of accountability and maintains a clear corporate structure. The presence of supervisors and team leaders in the office creates a professional atmosphere where expectations are transparent and responsibilities are enforced. This structure is essential for effective management, ensuring that projects stay on track and company goals are met.

Incident of the student assaulting a teacher in Georgia proves why cell phones are not needed. There are ways to get a student's attention In a emergency situation without them having a phone.,"A student in Georgia has caused national buzz by assaulting a teacher when asked to put their phone away. The situation even called for  lawmakers in the state to introduce legislation that will make parents responsible for their child's actions. Instances like this prove to not only be a distraction for students, they can be quite disruptive to entire classrooms. Therefore, I believe that public schools should bring smartphones during the school day. With the banning of the smartphones, students are able to focus more so on the learning materials and are less likely to pay attention to games, text messages, and other distractions. Students focusing on class materials can help improve grades, which will have lasting effects on their scholastic and professional careers. If an emergency situation arises, then there are other avenues that can be taken without a student being reliant on a cell phone. For example, a parent or guardian can call the front office to relay any information to a student. While it may take longer for a big student to receive the information, it is less of a destruction to the entire class and will not disrupt the teacher by having to stop and reprimand a student for being on their phones. If the student needs to leave the school for whatever reason, they can easily come back to a classroom, grab their stuff, and inform the teacher of the situation.

67fffee26ec983c07f3a2abd,1,a3,"I think that large employers should allow fully remote schedules by default.  Reasons for allowing this:  1) Better work/life balance for the employee - and a happier employee is a more efficient and productive employee. 2) Saves the worker valuable commute time during the day which can allow them more rest/sleep time. 3) Reduced stress leading to better quality work, and less distractions leading to a more productive work environment. 4) Healthier workers - reduced stress, eating better, and having time to exercise should reduce the amount of time that they are off sick. 5) More loyalty to the employer - a worker that appreciates their employer letting them work from home will be a worker less likely to switch companies/jobs. 6) Less distractions at a home-based work environment compared to an office.","Large employers should offer their workers fully remote schedules by default, this will provide a long-term benefit to both the employer and the employee.

There are less distractions for them at a home-based work environment compared to an office so they're able to make their output more efficient. And the time saved by the worker during the commute to and from work allows them more time to rest, sleep, exercise, and eat healthier meals instead of rushing to eat on the go. Having a more restful life and healthier eating leads to less stress and a more healthier body in general which reduces the time that they would otherwise be off stick. Work sickness has been an issue in office work for decades due to overworked and overstressed employees, and working from home can give people enough time to do their work and non-work activities without leading to time taken off sick which is a constant issue with employers needing to provide adequate cover. Also, a worker who is enjoying their work in a relaxed home-based environment is much more likely to feel loyalty to their employer in the long term and so would be less likely to switch jobs/companies once they've set themselves up in a work environment that is good for their wallet as well as good for their health and life in general.

Saves time that can be used for other activities. Can be home to provide care for family when workload allows. Employers: Less need for office space. Can hire employees from anywhere and not just locally. Gives them a competitive hiring advantage over businesses that require in office working full time.,,"In recent years, the debate over whether large employers should require workers to return to the office several days a week or allow fully remote schedules by default has gained considerable attention. While in-person collaboration has its merits, the advantages of working from home present a strong case for making remote work the default option for many employees. Both workers and employers stand to benefit significantly from flexible, home-based work arrangements.  For employees, working from home eliminates the daily commute, which often consumes valuable time and energy. Avoiding long drives or crowded public transit not only saves money on fuel and public transportation fares but also reduces wear and tear on personal vehicles, lowering maintenance costs. The time once spent commuting can instead be devoted to personal activities, rest, or family commitments, greatly improving work-life balance. Moreover, remote work allows employees to be physically present at home to provide care for family members when their workload permits, fostering a supportive environment that can enhance overall well-being and job satisfaction.  Employers, too, gain numerous advantages from allowing remote work by default. First and foremost, businesses can reduce expenses incurred by maintaining large office spaces, including rent, utilities, and maintenance costs. Additionally, remote work broadens the talent pool considerably, as companies are no longer restricted to hiring candidates from their local area. This geographic flexibility enables firms to recruit highly skilled employees regardless of location, increasing the quality and diversity of their workforce. Furthermore, offering remote work options grants employers a competitive edge in the hiring market. Many prospective employees now prioritize flexibility, and companies that embrace remote work can attract and retain top talent more effectively than those insisting on full-time office presence.

","Public schools should permit limited use of smartphones for learning and emergencies.  There is a lot of positive things that can come out of the use of smartphones in school.  The reasons are they can be used in a school emergency, they can be used for learning in class, and they can be helpful for downtimes and more.  A very important reason is that smartphones can be used in a school emergency.  It is imperative that students have access to their phone if there is an emergency because it could help get officers and other personnel to the campus quicker than waiting for someone to find out there is an emergency.  Students are likely to grab their phone and report it once they see it, otherwise that is a lot of downtime in between to get the help that may save someone's life. There is an increase of mass school shootings and questionable school safety in general going on now days.  It is a sad time that we live in, but we have to do what we can to keep out kids safe.  It is sad when a government is more worried about students using cell phones at school than school safety. Also, a lot of schools have apps that the students can utilized to submit a tip that is kept confidential to help school officers catch someone who may be doing wrong.  Having the access to the phone is huge in these situations.  Another reason is that smartphones are great resources in learning.  There are many learning apps and of course websites that can be used directly from their smartphones which are at their fingertips.  It makes for quick use when they are learning something new or even playing learning games.  If this is used with supervision and limited use, this could be a profound tool to aide in learning.  Last, phones have been used for students during down times in school.  I have seen students use them to play music to help people with anxiety, ADHD and/or learning disorders to help calm them before activities.  I have experienced where students have used smartphones that play music for testing purposes to help ease their testing anxiety and have had a lot of success.  This of course is monitored and approved by the staff in the school but is very helpful for the student.  In conclusion, you can see all the reasons on why using smartphones in school can be beneficial and helpful to not only the students but even the school.  In the end, the school should be a safe place to learn and a place where students can be who they are and have access to these important tools.

67ef53cadb2da106db5e5705,3,b2,"Personally, I think cities should ban gas-powered leaf blowers to reduce noise and air pollution for the following reasons. To reduce air pollution. The gas powered leaf blowers causes a lot of pollution, which in return causes other health related problems. Noise pollution also isn't good for human, and hence banning gas powered blowers will reduce noise pollution. Banning gas will also contribute towards the solving of climate change, which is a global challenge Even though my opponent might argue that banning the gas powered leaf blowers means taking freedom from the people, and also it is expensive to replace them. But looking at the big picture, I think banning will result in positive outcomes which outweighs the negatives.",,"In many cities, the debate over whether to ban gas-powered leaf blowers has gained significant attention. Personally, I believe that cities should ban these machines to reduce both noise and air pollution, ultimately promoting healthier and more sustainable communities.  Firstly, gas-powered leaf blowers contribute substantially to air pollution. These devices emit harmful pollutants, including carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and volatile organic compounds, which not only degrade air quality but also lead to serious health problems such as respiratory issues and cardiovascular diseases. By banning gas-powered leaf blowers, cities can significantly cut down on these emissions, creating a cleaner and safer environment for residents.  In addition to air pollution, noise pollution caused by gas-powered leaf blowers is a considerable concern. The loud noise produced by these machines can disrupt daily life, disturb neighbors, and contribute to stress and anxiety. Reducing the use of gas-powered blowers will help lower overall noise levels in neighborhoods, fostering a more peaceful and comfortable living environment.  Moreover, banning gas-powered leaf blowers can contribute positively to the global fight against climate change. These machines rely on fossil fuels that release carbon dioxide, a major greenhouse gas, into the atmosphere. By eliminating gas-powered blowers and encouraging the use of electric or manual alternatives, cities can reduce their carbon footprint and support broader climate goals.  Opponents may argue that banning gas-powered leaf blowers infringes on personal freedom and imposes financial burdens on homeowners and landscapers who must replace their equipment. While there is some validity to this concern, it is important to consider the larger picture. The health benefits, noise reduction, and environmental gains far outweigh the short-term inconveniences and costs. Cities must prioritize the well-being of their communities and the environment for the greater good.  In conclusion, banning gas-powered leaf blowers is a necessary step for cities aiming to reduce air and noise pollution and combat climate change. While challenges exist, the long-term advantages make such a ban a positive and responsible choice.","Cities Should Ban Gas-Powered Leaf Blowers to Reduce Noise and Pollution  In recent years, the debate over whether cities should ban gas-powered leaf blowers has gained significant attention. Personally, I believe that cities should implement such bans to reduce both noise and air pollution, which would benefit public health and the environment.  One of the primary reasons I support banning gas-powered leaf blowers is to reduce air pollution. These machines emit a considerable amount of harmful pollutants, including carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and volatile organic compounds. These emissions not only degrade air quality but also contribute to respiratory problems such as asthma and other chronic conditions. By eliminating gas-powered blowers, cities can improve the overall health of their residents and reduce the strain on healthcare systems.  Additionally, noise pollution caused by gas-powered leaf blowers is a substantial concern. The loud, constant noise can disrupt the peace of neighborhoods, negatively impacting mental well-being and productivity. Prolonged exposure to such noise can lead to increased stress levels, hearing loss, and sleep disturbances. Banning these noisy machines would create a quieter, more pleasant environment for everyone.  Moreover, a ban on gas-powered leaf blowers aligns with broader efforts to combat climate change. These devices contribute to greenhouse gas emissions that accelerate global warming, a challenge that demands collective action. Transitioning to electric or manual alternatives reduces carbon footprints and promotes sustainable urban living.  Opponents might argue that banning gas-powered leaf blowers infringes on personal freedom and that replacing equipment can be costly for homeowners and landscapers. However, when considering the bigger picture, the benefits of cleaner air, reduced noise pollution, and climate change mitigation significantly outweigh the drawbacks. Cities have a responsibility to prioritize public health and environmental sustainability over convenience.  In conclusion, banning gas-powered leaf blowers is a necessary step toward healthier, quieter, and more sustainable communities. The positive outcomes from such policies will far surpass the temporary inconveniences faced by individuals, making the decision both justified and important."

What is the average number of defaulted loans? What could the economic impact be if these borrowers able to spend this money on other goods and services?  What are the was of addressing student loan debt that do not involve forgiveness? What are the financial impacts on the federal government for student loan forgiveness? What would the impact be on the federal government of one of these alternative ways of addressing loan debt?,,"Student loan debt in the United States has reached staggering levels, with outstanding student loans totaling approximately $1.6 trillion. This debt is held by borrowers across various age groups, with a significant portion owed by individuals under 40, but a growing number of older Americans are also carrying student loan balances. On average, borrowers pay around $400 per month to service their student loans, a financial burden that can inhibit their ability to save, invest, or participate fully in the economy. Additionally, default rates on these loans remain concerning, with about 10% of borrowers defaulting within the first few years of repayment.  The economic impact of alleviating student loan indebtedness could be profound. If borrowers were relieved from or had reduced monthly payments, they might increase spending on goods and services, thereby stimulating economic growth. Increased consumer spending could benefit businesses, create jobs, and lead to higher tax revenues, which partially offset the initial cost of loan relief programs.  However, student loan forgiveness is not the only path to addressing this issue. Alternative strategies include income-driven repayment plans that adjust payments based on borrowers’ ability to pay, expanding access to loan refinancing at lower interest rates, and increasing funding for grants and scholarships to reduce the need for loans in the first place. These alternatives may offer more sustainable, targeted approaches to reducing borrower stress without the broad fiscal impact of wholesale debt cancellation.  From a fiscal perspective, broad student loan forgiveness would impose significant costs on the federal government, potentially adding hundreds of billions to the national debt. This could necessitate increased taxes or reduced spending in other critical areas. Conversely, alternative solutions such as refinancing or income-driven repayment plans could be less costly in the short term and promote responsible lending practices.  In conclusion, while broadening student loan forgiveness programs offers immediate relief for many borrowers, prioritizing alternative ways to address education debt may present a more balanced approach. These methods can provide sustainable economic benefits without imposing excessive financial burdens on the federal government, ensuring that education remains accessible and affordable for future generations.","Student loan debt in the United States has reached staggering levels, with outstanding student loans totaling approximately $1.6 trillion.

An income based repayment plan would also burden borrowers with debt for longer in their lives.  From a fiscal perspective, broad student loan forgiveness would impose significant costs on the federal government, potentially adding hundreds of billions to the national debt. This could necessitate increased taxes or reduced spending in other critical areas. Fiscal conservatives would always find umbrage with providing people money unless the people receiving federal dollars are oil and gas companies, political cronies, or themselves as was seen in the number of republican PPP loans that were discharged.  Conversely, alternative solutions such as refinancing or income-driven repayment plans could be less costly in the short term and promote responsible lending practices although no one brought the issue of these ""responsible lending practices"" when a generation of students were pushed into 4 year universities.

Another benefit from allowing pupils no access to their phones during the day will be the fact that their communication skills will improve!All to often nowadays you see groups if you peop",,"In recent years, the presence of smartphones in schools has become a topic of considerable debate. While some advocate for limited use of these devices for learning and emergencies, I firmly believe that public schools should ban smartphones for all pupils during the school day. The primary reason for this stance is that mobile phones serve as a constant distraction, preventing students from fully engaging in their lessons and focusing on their education.  Many pupils are persistently tempted to sneak a glance at their phones, whether in class, in the restroom, or while transitioning between lessons. This behavior interrupts their concentration and detracts from the educational environment that schools strive to maintain. The main purpose of attending school is to learn, and smartphones often divert attention away from this goal. Instead of fostering productive learning habits, mobile devices can encourage multitasking and reduce comprehension of the material being taught.  In cases where students need to contact their parents, such as to inform them about a cancelled match or change in transportation plans, there should be alternative communication methods available. Schools can provide access to a dedicated school mobile phone or a fixed-line phone, ensuring that students can reach out in emergencies without needing to carry their personal smartphones. Additionally, if students require devices for independent learning activities, the school should supply a set of tablets or iPads specifically for educational purposes. This eliminates the need for pupils to rely on their own mobile devices during school hours.  Moreover, banning smartphones during the day allows pupils to ‘detox’ from constant screen time and digital distractions. It also promotes better social interaction and communication skills, which are often undermined when students focus more on their phones than on face-to-face conversations. Groups of young people frequently appear isolated from one another despite being physically together, due to their engagement with phones. Removing these devices from the school environment encourages more meaningful connections among peers.  In conclusion, while smartphones may have their benefits, the distractions they cause in a school setting outweigh these advantages. Banning smartphones during the school day helps maintain a focused learning atmosphere, supports alternative communication methods, and enhances students’ social skills. Public schools should therefore implement a complete ban on smartphones for all pupils during school hours.","In today’s increasingly digital world, the presence of smartphones in schools has become a controversial topic. While some argue for limited use of phones during the school day to aid learning and for emergencies, I firmly believe that public schools should ban smartphones for all pupils. The primary reason for this is that mobile phones serve as a constant distraction, preventing students from fully engaging in their lessons.  Many pupils are tempted to sneak a look at their phones throughout the day, whether during class, between lessons, or even in the restroom. This behavior diverts their attention away from the main purpose of being at school: to learn. The temptation to check messages, social media, or play games can reduce concentration and negatively impact academic performance. A smartphone ban would help ensure that students remain focused and present in the classroom.  In situations where pupils need to contact their parents, such as when a match is cancelled and transportation arrangements need to be changed, schools can provide alternatives. A designated school mobile phone or access to a fixed-line phone should be available to students for such emergencies. This approach addresses communication needs without compromising the learning environment. Furthermore, for educational purposes that require the use of technology, schools should provide communal devices like iPads. These can be carefully monitored and used exclusively for learning activities, eliminating the necessity for students to rely on their personal smartphones.  An important additional benefit of banning smartphones during the school day is that it allows students to “detox” from constant digital stimulation. This break from screens encourages more face-to-face interaction, helping to improve communication skills. It is all too common nowadays to see groups of young people absorbed in their phones rather than engaging with each other directly.  In conclusion, schools should ban smartphones during the school day to reduce distractions, maintain focus on learning, and promote better interpersonal skills among pupils. This policy supports a healthier, more productive educational environment for all students."

Addressing Arguments against student Loans >unfair/unequitable 5. Positive Solutions and Impact for in support >Economy strengthen >fund areas of economy where jobs are understaffed 5.  Call to Action/Statement in support of student loan repayment,"Student Loan debt in America is a problem that impacts many people in the younger generations Gen Z, X and Y today.  These generations grew up in a time when the idea was widely supported that if you do well in school and make it through college, the rewards in return will secure a great job and foundation of your success.  However, in 2025 that path leads to all but uncertainty and is not the surefire equation it once was.   To achieve this, millions of young people secured student loans before entering college to further reach that promise of a secure future and job in the end, with relatively ease of paying it back.  Unfortunately today, we live in a nation where it is more expensive for your young people to take out student loans, than it is to buy a house.  There is over a trillion dollars in federal loan debt that needs repayed with the debt doubling in the last two decades.  The government needs to step in and broaden loan forgiveness programs.   Many people struggle with loan repayments today and are not able to move forward with their lives as they are hampered by this debt.   The financial institutions and schools who sold these loans also need regulation - student loan interest rate should be capped at a much lower percent.  These institutions also should be regulated to give out loans on professions where there is a reasonable chance an individual can secure a job and in turn repay.  These institutions and especially for profit colleges are almost predatory, similar to what ocurred during the housing and financial crisis.  It makes no sense to issue a 100,000 dollar loan to someone who is majoring in anthropology or a useless field. If there were stipulations that pushed people into programs like STEM, education, medical, social work, etc where there is a need for workers in these fields that would also help the shortage.  The state and federal government should implement more policies, where if you have an education degree and work in our city your loans are forgiven, of if you become a police officer, or a nurse etc.  We need our young people to have promising futures and we need more people in more in demand fields.     It has also been proven economically, when people become free from this student debt, they then have more money to spend and put back into the local economy- such as buying a house or car and other general things.  Releasing the debt burden is better for all.   The wages today have not kept up with costs of housing, college, and many other things that were very easy to afford for previous generations.    We need to urge our elected leaders and government to address this crisis and issue by implementing these programs, the future of our younger generations and the strength of our economy depends on it.",,"Student Loan debt in America is a problem that impacts many people in the younger generations of Gen Z, X and Y today.  These generations grew up in a time when the idea was widely supported that if you do well in school and earn a degree, the rewards in return will secure a great paying job and solidify the foundation for your success.  However, in 2025 that path leads to all but uncertainty and is not the infallible equation it once was.   To achieve this dream today, millions of young people secured student loans before entering college to further reach that promise of a prosperous future and job in the end, with the idea it would be relatively easy of paying it back.  Unfortunately today, we live in a nation where it is more expensive for your young people to take out student loans, than it is to buy a house.  There is over a trillion dollars in federal loan debt that needs repayed with the debt doubling in the last two decades.  The government needs to step in and broaden loan forgiveness programs.

We also need to help future young people understand debt and personal finance much better and need to bring personal finance education into our schools at the high school level.  Many of these young people barely understand the concepts of the loans they are signing up for.   The state and federal government should implement more loan forgiveness policies.  For example one such policy that has worked at the city level, is one that offers if you have an education degree and work in our city for 5 years your loans are forgiven.  Another could be, of if you become a police officer, or a nurse etc there would be an offer of loan forgiveness.  We need our young people to have promising futures and we need more people in these in demand fields to address labor shortages. It is truly a win for all.

Texting in class, posting to social media, playing games, these are all taking place in during school hours while students should be learning. Teachers have a hard time getting students to pay attention in class when a smartphone is the competition. I think all phones should be banned in elementary and middle schools. I do not see a reason students need their phones in classroom while they should be learning. Many states and school districts have already banned phones with the start of the 2025 school year and the consensus is students paying attention and actually getting their work done.  There have been many studies done that show social media and the constant access to phones causes the mental well being of adolescents to decline. Taking away phones during the school hours can reduce this stress level of always posting updates to social media or comparing oneself to others when they should be learning.   The only exceptions I see is to let High schoolers have their phones if learning activities can be done during class but if not needed then they need to be put away. Elementary students and middle school students can use school -approved devices for any tech based learning. If there is a medical reason for a child to have a phone, then an exception can be made as well.   To ease parents minds about emergencies or transportation issues, there needs to be new policies made. The benefits need to be explained clearly and emergency contact procedures in place. In conclusion, banning phones in school is a good idea. Students will pay attention more, there will be less disruptions during the day and teachers will not have to deal with unruly students if a phone needs to be taken away.

5cb62e9293342300017a72a1,2,a3,"I do not believe employers should force workers to return to the office, and should instead opt to allow for fully remote work environments. Reasons for my beliefs include: more flexibility within the work day; this allows for workers to not only attend to their work, but also that of their household, when applicable. Additionally, it cuts down on costs for transportation; with the increase in gas prices and cost of vehicle maintenance, working a full time job within a reasonable distance can sometimes not be possible. Remote work allows for that work to be completed anywhere, without the extra cost of gas and vehicle maintenance. I also think that it leads to better productivity and higher worker outcomes and overall improvement of work culture.   Forcing people to return to the office is arcane and seems to just be an overreach of power and inflexibility. I think forcing people to return to the office also feels very parental and dictatorial. It feels like employers may not treat staff like adults, but instead as cogs in a working machine, which I also think is strange.","Working models throughout time have consistently been centered around work culture and being physically present in an office. However, with the improvement of technology and innovation, the need to be in-office to complete computer-type work is a thing of the past, which is why I believe employers should more universally embrace fully remote work schedules, and avoid requiring in-office work of any sort.   I believe there are many benefits to working in a fully remote set up. The increase in flexibility being one; a diminishing of automotive expenses, commute time and gas expensing; and the overall improvement of worker outcomes and productivity, as a whole.   Working professionals are busy and their lives don't always revolve around work. In fact, many people have household priorities, like childcare, supporting a sick loved one, or just tending to the house and other domestic responsibilities. Those responsibilities shouldn't always wait until work is done, but in fact that coexist within the workplace. With remote work, professionals can complete their work, and also attend to household duties and tasks without either of them interfering with the other. This leads to better family dynamics and mental health for the entire family unit.   In addition, with the economically uncertain climate, gas prices and the cost of vehicle maintenance continues to go up. Commuting to work can be an unnecessary expense that remote work would eliminate. By not having to commute into work, professionals can instead use those saved funds on essential things that they need for their households, and they would also be able to save the overall stress and aggravation from commuting against busy traffic.   Finally, I think that a remote set-up leads to an improved outcome in productivity. While working from home, professionals are less likely to be interrupted by a coworker, or ringing phone, or general office chatter, and can instead really focus on their work in a comfortable environment. With improved focus, they can get their work done more efficiently.   ",,"Working models throughout time have consistently been centered around work culture and being physically present in an office.

63e51bdade16b861346088b4,3,b3,"Introduction: Outlining the problem of an uncontrollable growing amount of student-loan debt in the country.   Central argument: Younger generations such as Gen Z and Millennials were promised that going to college and getting a degree was a safe and ideal path for securing a job and making a living. Soaring housing costs, cost of living, and the disruption of the workforce by AI have made it so that getting a college degree is not a guarantee of a job and a comfortable living. These generations were falsely promised this by older generations and they deserve assistance through student loan forgiveness.   Supporting Arguments: The high cost of student loan monthly payments makes it hard to pay bills in a constantly more expensive society.   Conclusion: Student loands should be forgivven.",,"The escalating burden of student-loan debt in the United States has reached an alarming level, posing a serious threat to the financial stability and well-being of millions of Americans. Each year, more graduates find themselves trapped under the weight of loans that seem to grow faster than their ability to repay them. This crisis demands urgent attention, with the federal government facing a critical choice: to broaden student-loan forgiveness programs or to prioritize other solutions. Given the circumstances, expanding loan forgiveness is not only justified but necessary.  Younger generations, specifically Millennials and Gen Z, were raised with the common belief that attending college and earning a degree was the safest and most reliable pathway to gainful employment and a comfortable life. Unfortunately, this expectation has proven increasingly unreliable. Skyrocketing housing prices, rising costs of living, and rapid changes in the labor market owing to technological advances like artificial intelligence have severely disrupted job prospects. A college degree no longer guarantees the stable employment or economic security once promised. These younger Americans were encouraged to invest heavily in higher education under false pretenses, leaving them burdened with debt and limited prospects. It is fair and just for society to offer them relief through expanded student-loan forgiveness programs.  Furthermore, the crushing monthly payments required to manage student loans severely restrict financial flexibility. When coupled with rising expenses for essentials such as rent, healthcare, and food, these payments strain household budgets and reduce the ability of young adults to save, invest, or contribute to the economy. Forgiving student loans would alleviate this pressure, enabling borrowers to rebuild their financial lives and stimulate broader economic growth.  In conclusion, the federal government should broaden student-loan forgiveness programs. Doing so would address a broken promise, relieve the financial hardships facing younger generations, and promote a healthier economy. Student-loan forgiveness is not merely a financial policy—it is a necessary step toward fairness and economic justice.","The rising burden of student-loan debt in the United States has become an uncontrollable crisis affecting millions of Americans. With outstanding student debt surpassing $1.7 trillion, many borrowers struggle to keep up with monthly payments while managing other living expenses. This growing financial strain calls for urgent federal intervention to alleviate the burden on current and future graduates.  Younger generations, particularly Millennials and Gen Z, were led to believe that obtaining a college degree guaranteed a stable job and a comfortable life. This narrative, largely perpetuated by older generations, positioned higher education as a safe investment for economic security. However, soaring housing costs, increasing living expenses, and ongoing disruptions in the labor market caused by automation and artificial intelligence have shattered this promise. Today, many degree holders face underemployment or unemployment, making it difficult to repay student loans. This disconnect between expectation and reality highlights the need to reconsider how society supports those burdened by education debt.  Moreover, the high monthly payments required for student loans often consume a significant portion of borrowers’ income, leaving little room for necessities such as rent, healthcare, and food. In an economy where the cost of living continues to rise, the weight of student debt exacerbates financial insecurity and stifles economic mobility. Young families often need both partners to work in order to survive, which adds even more additional costs such as childcare into the equation. Poor social services, expensive healthcare costs, and insufficient opportunities for maternity and paternity leave compared to other countries all contribute to younger generations' struggles to make ends meet.   Forgiving student loans would provide immediate relief, allowing individuals to redirect their resources towards building wealth, purchasing homes, or investing in their futures.  In conclusion, broadening student-loan forgiveness programs is a necessary step to address the unjust financial challenges confronting younger generations. By acknowledging the broken promises linked to higher education and the harsh economic realities of modern life, the federal government can foster greater equity and economic stability. Rather than prioritizing alternative solutions that may take years to yield results, immediate loan forgiveness offers a direct and impactful means of supporting millions of Americans in distress."

I am not an expert or trying to claim to know all the answers, but I feel there are bigger issues in the education system that needs to be addressed. Student-loan forgiveness only scratches the surface of much bigger issues that are plaguing the education system and I hope to talk a bit about them here and inspire some though.  First, I would like to go through some issues I have noticed in the education system. Education institutions - especially the elite institutions - are quite rich. They have accumulated wealth, and continue to profiteer while their students struggle so much - both financially and because of the stresses brough on by their studies. This does not seem right that the suffering is so great on one end, while the institutions themselves are so comfortable. I also feel that education insitutions have become disconnected from society and the workforce. Students have difficulty transitioning into the workforce, and companies keep raising the requirements - that cannot be reasonably be met in the education system. We need to find ways to improve education transition into the workforce. I also personally feel we need to remove political stuff from schools. These are complex topics that really need to include all of society - all ages and groups.  Some solutions to these issues include investing the profits from these institutions to expand facilities so that the needs of society can be met - I see no reason why the education system shouldn't be able to meet the growing population. Why is there such a scarcity of positions available? This only causes fighting for positions - surely this isn't necessary. Right now feels like education institutions encourage elitism and reward a small number of high performers. The role of education institutions in society needs to be discussed and defined better.

Student-loan forgiveness only scratches the surface of much bigger issues that are plaguing the education system and I hope to talk a bit about them here and inspire some thought. For example, even with loan forgiveness, tuition at elite universities continues to rise faster than inflation, and many graduates still struggle to find jobs that match their skills, indicating deeper structural issues.  First, I would like to go through some issues I have noticed in the education system. Educational institutions - especially the elite institutions - are quite rich. For example, some elite universities hold endowments exceeding tens of billions of dollars, while tuition fees have risen sharply compared to inflation over the past decade. While elite universities hold large endowments, much of these funds are often legally restricted for specific uses such as scholarships or faculty support, making the relationship between endowment size and student costs complex.

By editing genes in unborn children, we can now identify and remove those 'bugs' which would lead the child to be born with incurable, painful, lifelong disabilities. It is by all means, a modern miracle.  Of course, the benefits cannot be understated for the child and their loved ones. But for society as a whole, imagine a world where we could substantially reduce pressures on healthcare services, and the burden placed on our infrastructure, from those born less fortunate.

While these views are understandable, they can also be applied to modern medicine as a whole. Are vaccines not playing god? Are lung transplants not playing god? Surely it is widely known that a child born in the UK, will have a better health outlook than a child born in Malawi?  We must not allow these fears, and such irrationality, to hold back our species. For if we did, we would never have developed life saving vaccines, amongst other modern medicine, and the amount of suffering and pain unnecessarily existing in the world would be impossible to comprehend.  In conclusion, gene editing is a modern miracle, giving us the ability cure incurable diseases, before they first appear. Any god worth believing in, would support mankind's efforts as it develops this miracle treatment."

Thus, the question of how society should act given this ability to edit our genetic code and its moral implications are not as distant as they might seem. It is not as simple as banning all forms of genetic modification, as that would cause many unnecessary deaths, but unregulated genetic modification can also be extremely problematic. We discuss both issues below. The truth of the matter is that many hereditary diseases are incurable.One such example is fatal familial insomnia, which is recessive, making it exceptionally rare, but it is very deadly and causes great suffering.

True universal access to education requires making higher education cheap or even free.  Intro: Thesis + Fluff  Paragraph 1: Establish student debt crisis and importance of education (The Average American owes ~40,000)  Paragraph 2: While well-intentioned, student loan forgiveness is a band-aid. It's a temporary and incomplete solution.  Paragraph 3: The key is to reduce costs. (Australia as an example?)",,"The rising burden of student loan debt is a defining challenge for millions of Americans today. With the average borrower owing around $40,000, the student debt crisis has far-reaching implications on individuals’ financial stability and the broader economy. Education remains a vital pathway to personal advancement and societal progress, yet the soaring costs threaten to exclude many from accessing higher education. In addressing this issue, while expanding student-loan forgiveness programs might offer immediate relief, it falls short as a lasting solution. To truly ensure universal access to education, the federal government must focus on making higher education more affordable or even free.  The student debt crisis is undeniable, with nearly half of all college graduates carrying significant loan balances. These debts influence life decisions, from delaying home ownership to forgoing starting a family, effectively stalling generations’ economic growth. Education itself is crucial—not only for individual success but also as a driver of innovation and a competitive workforce. Thus, the stakes are high for governments and society to find sustainable solutions that do more than simply erase debt after it has accumulated.  Student-loan forgiveness programs, while well-meaning and popular, essentially act as a temporary band-aid over a deeper problem. Forgiveness initiatives typically provide debt relief for borrowers after years of repayment or through partial cancellation. However, these programs do not address the underlying issue of why college costs continue to spiral upwards. Without tackling the root causes, such forgiveness efforts risk recurring debt crises as new students continue to incur high expenses.  The more effective approach centers on reducing the cost of higher education itself. Countries like Australia have implemented systems that limit upfront costs for students through income-contingent loan repayment models and increased public investment in universities. By focusing on affordability from the start, the government can prevent overwhelming debt and improve access for all socioeconomic groups. Making higher education cheap or free is not merely an idealistic vision but a practical necessity to break the cycle of debt and broaden opportunities for all Americans.  In conclusion, although student-loan forgiveness offers temporary relief, it cannot resolve the systemic issues behind the education debt crisis. True progress depends on reimagining the cost structure of higher education itself to ensure it is accessible and affordable. Only then can higher education fulfill its promise as a universal ladder to opportunity.","College is important. Not only is it a pathway to a middle-class lifestyle, but learning and exploring how the world works is a good in itself. However, too many people find this experience out of reach. In the United States, people aggressively pursue college, only to be saddled with debt that can take years to pay off. It is tempting to see debt forgivness as a path to fixing this issue, but a more holistic approach is necessary. It is better to bring the cost of college down for a more permanent solution to the issue.  The student debt crisis is undeniable. With the average American student saddled with almost $40,000 worth of debt. For some, the issue is even more dramatic. Horror stories make the rounds on the news or on social media of students saddled with hundreds of thousands of dollars of debt. For some, the money they spent in college follows them their whole lives. The debt is difficult to discharge as well, not even bankruptcy can remove it in most cases.  It is very natural to want to help these students with a forgiveness program. And perhaps one could be helpful. However, it only makes sense to do so in the context of a broader reduction in college costs. Otherwise, the current students will find themselves in better financial shape, but future students will not. Examples of this working successfully can be found abroad.

And to that, it is important to consider that nobody wants to pay off debt, nor do people want to be in debt. It isn't about pushing people down to get to the top; it's about lifting others and helping those around you. It should be a community, not a competition.

A specific example of this is having interest every month despite paying hundreds of dollars toward student loan debt. Since there is an increase in cost and interest, it ends up causing people to have to pay even more debt back than they had initially taken out. Rather than making people struggle more, expanding student-loan forgiveness programs can give people a much-needed break to focus on things that matter: family, education, jobs, community, and connection. Humanity shouldn't be destined to be miserable; they should find a community and enjoy the little things and love the life they have. Forgiving student loan debt is just one easy way to help with that.       Taking all this into account, it is imperative to give students the chance to discover themselves and settle into adulthood. Students should not have debt when they are barely even adults. 18 is young, and giving young adults time to discover their passions and settle down without having debt hanging over their heads can lead to more productive, successful, and well-adjusted individuals. People who argue against student loan forgiveness believe that people will be less motivated to work hard, and that if they paid off their debt years ago, why shouldn't others have to do the same? And to that, it is important to consider that nobody wants to pay off debt, nor do people want to be in debt. It isn't about pushing people down to get to the top; it's about lifting others and helping those around you. It should be a community, not a competition.        Ultimately, the federal government should broaden student loan forgiveness programs and allow students to pursue higher education without feeling like they are choosing between their education and their livelihood. They shouldn't feel like the choice to go to college will leave them floundering and struggling for the rest of their lives. Students should want to pursue a higher education to feel more prepared and educated, not because they feel like they have to, potentially taking on more debt than they could ever pay off. We should want smarter, more educated, and hardworking citizens. Student loan debt needs to go. "

Therefore, genetic editing should be regulated to permit only interventions aimed at preventing serious diseases while prohibiting enhancements unrelated to health, to preserve ethical standards and diversity. Allowing people the freedoms to better human development is important because genetic modifications can improve lives and prevent fatal conditions.

The technology is available - as long as it is safe, parents should be allowed to make decisions about genetic modification 2. From what I understand, most arguments against this tend to fall into a moral realm based on pre-conceived notions that fetuses have a right to bodily autonomy, or that genetically modifying to prevent diseases could be viewed as genocide of certain diverse populations, which leads me to... 3. Genetically editing fetuses to prevent disease offers nothing but benefits for the unborn child and society as a whole. Moral claims should carry no weight to this subject as the benefits are tangible and the decision to participate is personal.","I believe that parents should have the right to genetically edit their unborn children to prevent diseases. The technology is available, so as long as it is safe parents should be allowed to choose between taking advantage of it or declining. Most arguments against it are only argued from a moral standpoint - e.g. ""it's not natural"" or ""diversity will be at risk"". I do not believe this to be the case, as genetic modification does not logically lead to a detrimental decline in genetic diversity - only the eradication of certain diseases. Genetic editing has an overwhelming positive potential for society with only limited, moral risks.  With the existing technology, genetic modification is rapidly advancing and is only going to continue to be safe. It's not a matter of if the technology will be capable of being fully available or safe, it's a matter of individuals moral principals. I'd be against forcing parents to genetically modify their unborn children, but I am also equally against not allowing parents to CHOOSE to do so. As parents, we have the right to decide what is best for our children as long as we are not putting them in danger. If the technology is available, being denied access and forcing children to be born with preventable diseases is not only inhumane, but forces the child to carry a disease for what some perceive as ""the greater good of society""... no one should be forced to carry that burden.  Any diversity lost would easily be regained as we are not altering the entire child, we are treating certain aspects of their genetics. From my understanding it is simply the refinement of our humanity, and as children who received genetic editing mature and become adults they will reproduce with others and be able to pass along stronger genetics that are still unique as a result of pro-creation. The only moral weight that should be considered here is what is best for the child, not society.  In conclusion, I believe that genetically editing unborn children to prevent diseases offers overwhelming benefits for the child with limited and temporary risks for society at large.

5ef07f0ba383185b3570273e,1,a1,"Introduction Discuss how and why pupils might bring mobile phones into school  Paragraph one: Problems with mobile phones in school - that they are disruptive, photos taken without consent, and content uploaded onto social media  Paragraph two: How phones can be useful. Discuss uses for phones and their limitations. E.g., useful for study but creates inequality with those who do not have phones Emergency use - but the school should handle this. After school journeys in case of an emergency  Paragraph three Conclusion As even most benefits have limitations, phones should not be used or seen in schools. Compromise - bring phones but leave them in school office or keep them switched off","Mobile phones in schools are a new problem. Even 10 - 15 years ago, smartphone usage was not commonplace for children. But now many school-aged children have their own smartphone and want to bring it to school. This means that schools have had to produce policies on phone usage within schools, with many schools considering whether to ban them from the premises.  The reasons for not having phones on school are compelling. They can be disruptive. Calls, texts, and notifications create noise and this is multiplied many times over in large class sizes. It is hard to teach when you are continually disrupted by these notifications. And of course if you get a notification, it is instinct to want to check it, causing students to become distracted and missing out on valuable learning. Another issue is the use of mobile phones in bullying. Virtually all phones have a camera that may be used to capture shots of students or staff in a way that belittles them with the content quickly uploaded to social media, where it spreads rapidly. They may also get used in particularly inapporpriate settigns such as toilets and changing rooms, capturing students in a state of undress. Again, such pictures cna be shared rapidly, bringing considerbale distress to those involved.  However, phoens do ahve their uses. Tbey can be a powerful educational tool, with the chance for students to use them to carry out their own research. But this is not somethign that cna part of formal lessons since not eveyr child will have aprents who can afford a smartphone and so use of them in school cna icnrease inequality. Phones are also useful for students if they need to content parents in an emergency. But the school should be aware of an emergency and s it is preferable that emergency contatc is carried out through the school. Probably the best example of a need for a mobile phone is on the journey to and from school or to alert aprents afetr shcool to any changes of plans.

This will allow students to have the sfaety and conveneinece of their phones for the jhourney with none of the downsides of having them used in school.",,"Mobile phones in schools are a new problem. Even 10 - 15 years ago, smartphone usage was not commonplace for children. But now many school-aged children have their own smartphone and want to bring it to school. This means that schools have had to produce policies on phone usage within schools, with many schools considering whether to ban them from the premises.  The reasons for not having phones on school are compelling. They can be disruptive. Calls, texts, and notifications create noise and this is multiplied many times over in large class sizes, making it hard to teach when you are continually disrupted by these notifications. And of course, if you get a notification, it is instinct to want to check it, causing students to become distracted and miss out on valuable learning. Another issue is the use of mobile phones in bullying. Virtually all phones have a camera that may be used to capture shots of students or staff in a way that belittles them, with the content quickly uploaded to social media, where it often spreads rapidly. They may also get used in particularly inappropriate settings, such as toilets and changing rooms, capturing students in a state of undress. Again, such pictures can be shared rapidly, bringing considerable distress to those involved. Cyberbullying is a real problem among young people and the use of phones in school can exacerbate it, sometimes with tragic consequences.  However, phones do have their uses. They can be a powerful educational tool, with the chance for students to use them to carry out their own research. But this is not something that can be a part of formal lessons since not every child will have parents who can afford a smartphone, and so use of them in school can increase inequality. Phones are also useful for students if they need to contact parents in an emergency. But the school should be aware of an emergency and so it is preferable that emergency contact is carried out through or by the school. Probably the best example of a need for a mobile phone is on the journey to and from school or to alert parents after school to any changes of plans.  On balance, it does seem best if schools do not permit the use of mobile phones in schools. Safety must come first and the risk of phones being used in bullying is too severe. Schools are also a place of learning, something that will be disrupted if phones are continually pinging throughout lessons. A compromise is that phones can be brought in, but not used on school premises. This allows students to have their phones for the journey to and from school. Arrangements can be made,  such as leaving phones in the school office during the day or a strict policy that sees phones confiscated if they are seen or heard during the school day. This will allow students to have the safety and convenience of their phones for the journey with none of the downsides of having them used in school."

[been a while since I've been in a classroom environment]   Using smartphones as a learning tool >  education apps [weave into i.]  General safety concerns considering how commonplace school shootings have become  Speak on both pros and cons with conclusion focusing on how limitations are set/phones are used to improve educational experience while balancing safety concerns.      ,"I believe that banning smartphone usage in any academic setting isn't binary. Rather, it's a tool that can be leveraged for improved learning as long as proper guidelines are established. I will first outline the perceived negative effects, then explain how they can be circumvented, and conclude on the potential benefits.  The most common cons of smartphone usage could be summarized as follows. Reduced academic performance due to lower rates of classroom engagement from unnecessary distractions as well as the potential for students to cheat by looking up answers on the internet. While these are notable concerns, they are problems with simple solutions. Namely, students could be required to login through a school UI that provides Wi-Fi only for educational purposes. In the latter, all phones could simply be confiscated prior to any form of exam/test taking.  Using the framework in the first solution, educators can leverage the use of learning apps that have seen continual advancement and development to provide a more immersive learning experience. For instance, this has the potential of bridging the gap between audio and visual learners by providing resources that cover all bases for both parties. This could also provide teachers with more time to explain concepts that they would otherwise need to write out by hand be it on a white/blackboard. A secondary benefit of allowing phones would be the safety aspect due to the prevalence of emergency scenarios in schools.

It's undeniable that remote work offers adults more flexibility. It allows them the freedom to balance their work life with their personal life like never before. It's overall better for their mental health, and for their private lives. Why would an employer care anything about the personal effects of remote work? Because a happy, healthy workforce is a productive workforce.

I do not have the source on me, but as an example, in car accidents, those who text and drive have entire extra seconds they need to react to break. Those who do not use their phones in class are also more likely to take notes because they have idle hands. This, task-switching is reinforced with smartphone use being allowed in school.   This matters because these students are the next generation, the next engineers, doctors, lawyers, and even movie writers. If students cannot gain the integrity with the oral tradition of having knowledge passed down, then our society has hit a new low. We need people who can think critically or else the government will take advantage of it and if you have seen the film we will end up with something similar to Idiocracy.   Therefore, public schools should ban smartphones during the school day because their constant task-switching leads to ineffective learning and lesser engagement with improbable note-taking, and the next generation needs these skills so they can continue to advance society.

They can be a distraction and hindrance to learning.  Students need to learn how to think creatively, solve problems on their own, and interact face to face with fellow students and teachers and smartphones are a barrier to all of those.  The argument that students need smartphones for emergencies is null if each classroom has a landline.",,"In today’s digital age, the presence of smartphones has become ubiquitous among students. While these devices offer numerous benefits outside the classroom, public schools should ban smartphones during the school day. The distractions they cause outweigh any potential advantages, and students’ educational and social development can be better supported without them.  First and foremost, smartphones are unnecessary for students during school hours. The primary purpose of the school day is learning, and smartphones often serve as a distraction rather than a helpful tool. Notifications from social media, games, and messaging apps divert students’ attention, reducing their focus on lessons and assignments. This disruption hinders academic performance, as students find it difficult to concentrate on classroom activities when tempted by their devices.  Moreover, the reliance on smartphones can impede important developmental skills. Schools should be environments where students cultivate creativity, problem-solving abilities, and interpersonal communication. When students have constant access to smartphones, they might rely too heavily on quick answers or digital interaction, rather than thinking critically or engaging face-to-face with peers and teachers. The absence of smartphones encourages more meaningful conversations, teamwork, and independent thinking—skills essential for success both inside and outside the classroom.  Some argue that smartphones are necessary for emergencies, providing students with a direct line to family or help if needed. However, this concern is addressed effectively through other means. Most classrooms are equipped with landline telephones, allowing prompt communication in case of emergency without the distractions or misuse that smartphones can bring. School staff can manage emergency protocols efficiently without relying on student-owned devices.  In conclusion, public schools should ban smartphones during the school day to maintain a focused learning environment and foster critical social and cognitive skills. The potential risks and distractions associated with smartphones outweigh their perceived benefits, especially when alternative communication methods exist for emergencies.

While some argue for limited use of smartphones for learning and emergencies, public schools should ban their use during the school day altogether. There are several compelling reasons to support this stance.  Firstly, smartphones present a significant barrier to effective learning. Students often find it difficult to concentrate on their studies when distracted by constant notifications, social media, and games. Excessive smartphone use can lead to reduced focus, lower retention of information, and ultimately, poorer academic performance. When the classroom environment is disrupted by these devices, the quality of education suffers, affecting both individual students and their peers.  Secondly, smartphones can unfortunately become tools for bullying. Social media abuse and digital harassment are rampant issues among school-aged children. Smartphones make it easier for bullies to target victims beyond the classroom walls through hurtful messages or exclusion online. Additionally, smartphones can highlight social inequalities within the student population. Those with the latest models may be perceived as more popular or wealthy, fostering resentment and division among students. This social dynamic exacerbates existing issues of bullying and peer pressure.  Moreover, even if smartphones are intended for educational purposes, controlling their use is challenging if not impossible. Students may easily switch from constructive activities to non-academic distractions such as messaging friends or browsing unrelated content. Teachers and staff cannot constantly monitor every student's device, making enforcement impractical and ineffective.  Finally, the argument that smartphones are necessary in emergencies is not convincing. Schools have established protocols for handling urgent situations. If a student faces an emergency, they can report it to a teacher or staff member who can then make the necessary calls.

Since that role is not illuminated within any of our founding documents, the fact that it is a responsibility of the Department of Education does not make it acceptable or constitutional by any means.  Since the decision to pursue higher education is one that an individual willingly engages in, the responsibility and debt incurred shouldn't be any different than taking out a car loan or a personal loan, or a mortgage on a house, all of which the borrower is solely responsible for. That isn't the case that was student loans with student loans, the government inserted itself into that process, and as a result, overstepped the limits of its power and acted outside of its purview.   Simply put, if we expect individuals who take out loans for a car, house, or any other expense to be solely responsible for the repayment of that loan, and the Market has providers that will lend to borrowers privately, there is no need for a governmental bureaucracy to be involved in student loan lending on any level. and the continued involvement is nothing short of unconstitutional and illegal, and as a result, should be shut down immediately in order to protect the rights of borrowers and to limit the size and influence of the federal government overall.",,"The issue of whether the federal government should broaden or prioritize student loan forgiveness programs. Other ways of addressing education debt are essentially a question of what role the government plays in education, and by what instrument the government is given the power to lend to students seeking higher education.  The simple answer is nowhere. Nowhere within the text of the Constitution does it empower the federal government to lend to private citizens to fund their higher education, tuition, and other costs. While the Constitution does not explicitly mention education, proponents argue that federal funding for student loans is authorized under the Spending Clause and Necessary and Proper Clause; however, these powers should not extend to creating debt forgiveness programs that exceed original constitutional intent. Since that role is not illuminated within any of our founding documents, the fact that it is a responsibility of the Department of Education does not make it acceptable or constitutional by any means.  Since the decision to pursue higher education is one that an individual willingly engages in, the responsibility and debt incurred shouldn't be any different than taking out a car loan or a personal loan, or a mortgage on a house. Unlike car or mortgage loans, student loans often carry broader economic implications because education can yield societal benefits. However, this does not automatically justify federal lending, especially when it creates unchecked government power and borrower dependency. all of which the borrower is solely responsible for. That isn't the case with student loans; the government inserted itself into that process, and as a result, overstepped the limits of its power and acted outside of its purview.   Simply put, if we expect individuals who take out loans for a car, house, or any other expense to be solely responsible for the repayment of that loan, and the market has providers that will lend to borrowers privately; Private lenders typically avoid offering large education loans without government guarantees due to high risk, limiting access for many students; reform efforts could focus on reducing bureaucracy while preserving necessary support mechanisms. There is no need for a governmental bureaucracy to be involved in student loan lending on any level, and the continued involvement is nothing short of unconstitutional and illegal, and as a result, should be shut down immediately to protect the rights of borrowers and to limit the size and influence of the federal government overall."

I'm sure that a lot of parents, and parents to be, wouldn't want those statements to be truths for their children to experience after they're brought into this world. Life can be unfair and hard enough without being born with diseases present at birth, or being destined to suffer from them later on in life. As long as the outcome is guaranteed to be positive, or is at least very likely to be positive, then I don't see the harm in parents being given the right to genetically edit their unborn child to prevent diseases. I don't think that being born with a disease is a desirable enough way to provide a life lesson to the sufferer on how diverse the human experience can be.",,"Most of us have heard the old adages: ""Life is unfair,"" and ""Life is hard."" These sayings reflect the reality that life often presents individuals with challenges and hardships. Naturally, many parents and parents-to-be hope to shield their children from unnecessary suffering. One of the most profound hardships a person can face is being born with a debilitating disease or being predisposed to severe illnesses later in life. Given this reality, it is understandable why some would argue that parents should have the right to genetically edit their unborn children to prevent such diseases.  Advancements in genetic technology have opened the door to the possibility of identifying and correcting genetic defects before a child is even born. If the outcome of such interventions is guaranteed or at least highly likely to be positive—resulting in a healthy life free from hereditary diseases—then restricting parents from utilizing these technologies seems unnecessarily cruel. Preventing suffering where possible is a fundamental human value, and genetic editing offers the potential to alleviate or eliminate a wide range of conditions, such as cystic fibrosis, Huntington’s disease, or certain forms of cancer. Denying parents this option would mean consigning children to potentially preventable pain and hardship.  Some argue that genetic modifications could threaten natural human diversity, which is often seen as a valuable attribute of our species. However, the presence of disease is not a beneficial form of diversity; it is a source of pain rather than strength. Being born with a disease should not be romanticized as a way to teach life lessons or to appreciate human variety. Instead, why should we accept avoidable suffering on the grounds of preserving diversity? There are countless other aspects of human variation—culture, personality, talents—that contribute to the rich tapestry of humanity without causing harm.  In conclusion, parents should have the right to genetically edit their unborn children to prevent diseases. Allowing such interventions aligns with the natural parental desire to protect children from suffering and promotes healthier lives.

They would however be fascinating to study and could perhaps lead to scientific breakthroughs that would otherwise be obscured from us. ",,"The idea of bringing back extinct species such as the woolly mammoth through genetic engineering has sparked significant debate. While the prospect of reviving these ancient creatures is fascinating and holds potential for scientific advancement, it is crucial to consider the possible consequences before crossing this natural boundary.  One major concern is the impact that reintroducing extinct animals could have on current ecosystems. Modern environments have evolved and adapted in the absence of these species, and their sudden reintroduction might disrupt the balance. New or reintroduced species could compete with existing wildlife for resources, potentially leading to unforeseen ecological problems. The delicate interplay among species is a result of millennia of evolution, and disturbing it risks cascading effects that are difficult to predict.  Furthermore, there is the danger of resurrecting unknown diseases. Extinct animals may carry pathogens that have long disappeared but could be harmful to contemporary species, including humans. Our lack of knowledge and preparedness to handle such diseases could result in public health crises. This risk underscores the precautionary principle, suggesting that we should avoid tampering with extinct species without fully understanding the potential ramifications.  Popular culture offers cautionary tales about the dangers of reviving extinct creatures. The movie Jurassic Park famously illustrated how genetic engineering, when rushed or mismanaged, can lead to severe safety risks and catastrophic outcomes. Although fictional, the narrative reflects real concerns about the ethical and practical challenges involved in de-extinction efforts. It reminds us that such scientific endeavors should not be undertaken lightly.  On the other hand, bringing extinct species back could provide invaluable opportunities for scientific study. Researchers could gain insights into evolutionary processes, genetics, and ancient ecosystems that are currently inaccessible.

The question of whether public schools should ban smartphones during the school day has sparked considerable debate. While some argue for limited use of these devices for learning and emergencies, a closer examination reveals that banning smartphones is a more prudent approach. Smartphones present several challenges in educational settings, including facilitating cheating, causing distractions, and enabling bullying, all of which undermine the school environment.  First, smartphones have the potential to be used as cheating devices in classrooms. With internet access and messaging applications, students can easily look up answers or communicate covertly during tests and assignments. This compromises academic integrity and makes it difficult for teachers to accurately assess students’ understanding. The presence of smartphones thus threatens the fairness and effectiveness of the educational process.  Second, smartphones act as constant distractions that limit students’ concentration and engagement in learning. Notifications, social media, games, and messaging tempt students to divert their attention away from lessons. This fragmented focus hinders the absorption of material and adversely affects academic performance. Even with intentions to use smartphones for educational purposes, the risk of distraction remains significant.  Third, smartphones can be instruments for bullying during the school day. Cyberbullying is a serious problem among young people, and allowing students to have access to their phones at school increases the chances of harmful messages, exclusion, or harassment occurring in real time. Keeping smartphones out of the classroom helps foster a safer and more respectful environment for all students.  Proponents of limited smartphone use often claim these devices are necessary learning tools or emergency communication devices. However, these arguments are flawed. Teachers are fully capable of delivering instruction without reliance on students’ smartphones, and most classrooms are equipped with computers or tablets designed specifically for educational use. Additionally, in emergencies, it is not students who need to communicate, but rather the adults in charge, who have access to phones and other reliable means of contacting emergency services or parents.  In conclusion, public schools should ban smartphones during the school day. Their potential for cheating, distraction, and bullying far outweighs any claimed educational or emergency benefits. By restricting smartphone use, schools can promote integrity, focus, and safety, thereby creating a better learning environment for all students.","Should Public Schools Ban Smartphones During the School Day?

Some studies have shown that teams are more effective when working together in the same physical location, while other studies have demonstrated teams being more effective when working remotely. There is documented scientific evidence for both sides of the argument.  In my job as a software engineer, I find myself to be effective in a remote-focused but hybrid situation.

I find that balance suits me well.  However, we have different personality types on the team, and some people in our group prefer more direct in-person socializing, and they choose to be in the office more days per week. We have the flexibility to set a work schedule that prioritizes the needs of each individual employee.  There are many types of businesses where a virtual presence isn't feasible at all. For example, someone who is building robots might be able to do a good chunk of the work online, but they might have a stronger need for a centralized physical presence where they have access to the professional tools and equipment provided by the company.  The situation is highly dependent on the company, the type of work being performed, and the personalities of the people involved.

However, we have different personality types on the team, and some people in our group prefer more direct in-person socializing, and they choose to be in the office more days per week. We have the flexibility to set a work schedule that prioritizes the needs of each individual employee.  There are many types of businesses where a virtual presence isn't feasible at all. For example, someone who is building robots might be able to do a good chunk of the work online, but they might have a stronger need for a centralized physical presence where they have access to the professional tools and equipment provided by the company.  There are some types of jobs that cannot be performed remotely at all. For example, someone who is a construction worker can't really do their job remotely. Making an argument in favor of fully remote would not be applicable for these types of occupations.  The situation is highly dependent on the company, the type of work being performed, and the personalities of the people involved. Therefore I think it is kind of reductive to boil the topic down to 'should we do A or B', when the reality of the situation is much more nuanced."

This is because both sides would probably want what will fit them or what they’ll feel more comfortable with. In that case picking one would violate the others feelings. Anyways this is clearly employers versus employees. More than 90% of employees would absolutely love to work from home and not have to report to a central working area for a very long time. This is mostly due to proximity and also the issue of having to stay fit and keep in shape almost everyday of the week. Keeping appearances is pretty exhausting sometimes and no one would want to do that everyday. Working from home is certainly everyone’s dream unless they have terror or don’t like their home which is literally hard to find as well. But the other argument is that working from home also saves very much a lot of money as well. People would not have to pay for bus fares or buy a source of energy for their cars to move around with them. This would probably make it extremely suitable and easy to choose working from home or a comfortable remote area. Let’s not forget there’s also the issue of having various destructions in remote working areas or working places that allows going to central working areas more suitable. Now enough about the employees. Employers would definitely want to keep tabs on their employees and make sure that they’re doing due diligence in the work they’re being assigned to and being paid to do. This makes them see the results and see the value for money. Sometimes people do very cheap jobs and shoddy jobs when they’re in their comfort zones. But in the central place of work, everything has to be professional and everyone has to make sure they do well to impress lifting working standards.

The first problem is what kind of diseases are we talking about. Minor diseases that large amounts of the population are prone to, such as asthma and heart disease that is relatively well controlled, should not be edited out. However, in my opinion, parents should have the right to change the genes to prevent rarer diseases or diseases which would significantly shorten life or quality of life. There are additional questions that need to be answered though. Could editing genes to prevent these diseases lead to unknown or new issues, is there a risk that we could end up introducing new mutations that could create new diseases or problems for the baby? If we do end up with fewer rare diseases, are we really making the gene pool less diverse or are we merely preventing serious disease and suffering. There is a risk that parents may not just stop with disease prevention and we could end up crossing the line into full blown genetic modification. The lines could be blurred too as some could argue, for instance, that a baby with lighter skin is more prone to skin cancer thus blurring the lines in the future. There is also a risk that banning this could lead to the whole thing going underground. This could introduce risks for everyone with unscrupulous doctors who may well not be qualified to do such gene editing attempting to do this behind closed doors which could lead to bigger issues in the future both for the baby and, in the worst case scenario, for future generations if a gene that edited out or changed causes issues for future generations.

This is mostly dependent on the countries affairs economically. I believe entirely that if the country wouldn’t lose so much forgiving loans it should be the way to go. Also there should be a certain credible criteria to it. If the criteria is not clear and stable the government would lose more since taking out student loan would mean getting a freebie. The criteria to forgive should be maybe using a something like student who graduated in the first class division of their class that haven’t still been able to pay of their loans. Something like this is very much transparent and also rewarding to hardworking students who don’t have the financial means to pay of their loans. Other factors like students with disabilities and certain diseases could be also considered in this criteria which I believe makes sense.

Obviously when the nation starts to get into some sort of economic crisis and the money from student loans can help and also provided the debtors can pay then why not. But prioritizing is quite unnecessary I believe. In all it is my strong believe that freeing deserved people of their student loans will be somewhat beneficial to the nation considering the same people would grow up and be the nations workforce one day to come.

This editing could lead to children who no longer have certain disorders or pre-genetic markers for disease, yet possess certain eye colors, brain capacities and various other phenotypical and inward determiners that distinguish them. These can obviously be deemed as benefits for parents who are often on the quest for perfect children. There is of course an argument that these parents want to shield their future children from disease and suffering; however, there is also enough evidence throughout history to support superficiality worship. In considering this gene editing, what could go wrong while tampering with nature is not getting the desired result. Removing disorders could cause a deficit in other areas. Changing eye color could affect the eye sight. The conclusion here is that parents should most likely not have the right to genetically edit unborn fetuses to prevent disease. Most are not attempting to protect from disease, but are trying to strive for perfection. It is evident in society at all times how immensely superficial most people and parents are as they desire the look that everyone will notice, complement and adore. That adoration; however, interferes with self-esteem, self-acceptance, tolerance, growth, courage, kindness and love for others in the way they were and are actually born. It is better to be born and live as one is than to tamper with the sheer beauty that is each individual person.

Conclusion: balanced approach recommendation remains the best   ","The student debt problem has become a major concern across the United States. Many students graduate with loans they struggle to pay back for years or even in decades. This has led to an important debate about how federal government should tackle this issue.   Some people believe the government should expand the student loan forgiveness programs. The approach would cancel debts for millions of student, and give them immediate relief from their financial burden.

Many students graduate with loans they struggle to pay back for years or even decades. This has led to an important debate about how the federal government should tackle this issue.   Some people believe the government should expand the student loan forgiveness programs. The approach would cancel debts for millions of student, and give them immediate relief from their financial burden.  Those who support this idea point out that it would help them reduce the wealth gap between the different groups. Loan forgiveness can reduce the wealth gap by enabling borrowers from disadvantaged backgrounds to invest in assets like homes and retirement funds that build long-term wealth.

Reasons for smartphones mentioned: 1. use in learning...possibly, maybe for live polls or looking things up -seems plausible, but the counterargument is that they are distracting and doesn't allow for students to critically think and they can be distracted; which can lead to overall less learning than without it 2. use in case of emergencies -if there is a true emergency, it's likely that the student can get in touch without a smartphone...there are other devices (like watches) that can meet this need without the need for a smartphone.  ovearll, it's probably more beneficial to not have a smartphone vs having one ","With the ubiquity of smartphones in society, there are increasing proportion of students that have a smartphone. Annecdotally, the ages when students have smartphones is getting younger as parents want to be in contact with their kids in case of emergencies. Also, youths now grow up with this technology and is the primary way they communicate with their peers or others. This has been a crutch and it's debated if this helps or hurts their learning in a school setting. One argument for its benefit is that it can be used as part of the active learning process. For example, it can be used as a tool for answer questions that the teacher poses. This active learning is known to be a good strategy for learning. Also, a smarphone allows students to look up content easily if needed for activities that require it. On the other hand there are a few arguments againts the use of smartphones despite the aforementioned benefits. It is clear that having a smartphone is a temptation when it's available to students to be distracted, or worse, for cheating. When students have easy access to look things up, it makes the learning process less effective - critical thinking is not developed as efficiently and students can fall behind. At the same time, students that use smartphones during class (even when not allowed) can be a distraction to the teaching, and also to other students. This is similar to issues of students using other devices in class, like laptops or related devices with screens. Overall, despite the limited benefits that smartphones might have to educaiton, the negatives outweight that. In regards to safely, even though it might feel more safe if a student has a smartphone, it's unclear if the data supports this.

The only downside could be damages caused by reintroduction, would be the case of causing damages to the new environments the animals are placed into. If the habitats have naturally balanced itself out due to a lack of biodiversity, then adding new animals to the environment could produce ecological damage from over/under hunting of certain animals leading to even less biodiversity in the long term.

I think a good system to control smartphone use would be to have a system to leave smartphones outside the classroom during lessons to be collected when the lesson is over. The age of the student is also a factor to be taken into account. Primary school aged children are very different to college students and diffinately more monitoring is required of their smartphone use. Misuse of smartphones during lesson times creates another level of difficultly for teachers during giving their lessons, the students become distracted and the lessons may be constinatley interrupted and the students do not learn what is being taught which can lead to long term gaps in education. ",,"There is a strong argument that all schools should limit the use of smartphones during learning time. The distraction of a phone during learning time has been proven to take away from what is being presented during learning for young people. Studies by organizations like the Pew Research Center show that students using smartphones in class score lower on tests by an average of 10%. For example, a 2019 Pew Research Center study involving 1,000 high school students found that those who used smartphones during lessons scored on average 10% lower in standardized tests compared to peers who did not. The risks of social media misuse for young people are very real and having an enforced break during learning can be a benefit for students. Research indicates that social media distractions reduce student engagement by 15%, negatively affecting classroom performance. A good method to control smartphone use is to to leave smartphones outside the classroom during lessons to be collected when the lesson is over. Several schools that implemented phone-free classrooms reported improved student focus and higher test scores, indicating the effectiveness of this approach. However, this approach may cause issues such as emergency contact needs; schools could provide supervised access to phones during breaks. For instance, in cases of family emergencies, quick access to a phone is critical; therefore, supervised phone access during breaks ensures safety without compromising learning time. The age of the student is also a factor to be taken into account. For example, primary schools might require phones to be handed in during lessons, while college students could use phones under guided terms. Primary school aged children differ significantly from college students and definitely, more monitoring is required of their smartphone use. Misuse of smartphones during lessons creates additional challenges for teachers, For example, repeated student phone use can interrupt lesson flow and require teachers to spend additional time regaining attention. Students become distracted, lessons are frequently interrupted, and learning suffers which can lead to long term gaps in education. Research indicates that frequent distractions from smartphone use can reduce students’ retention rates by up to 20%, contributing to cumulative knowledge gaps over time. "

Smartphones are always useful but when it is being used in an environment when you need maximum concentration to learn it can really become a big distraction to students and ending up delaying the learning process for a student. Students tend to not want to read as much when the have their smart phone as some of them can use it to cheat as well, with so much AI LLM answers to questions can easily be accessed and students can take advantage of that if the had their smartphones in class ","Public schools should ban smartphones during the school day or permit limited use.  The use of smartphones in school is highly unnecessary and  schools will be doing students a favor by banning smartphones because smartphones are big sources of distraction for students and the more access students have the more problems the could have as time  goes on and as far as learning is concern.

But humans, by our very nature, are imperfect. We succumb to cancers, mental health issues, and diseases, but modern medicine has advanced many cures and prevention methods. We are still susceptible to so much. What if we could find a way to cure any genetic disease? Scientists have discovered ways to genetically edit their unborn children to prevent genetic mutations which cause disease. Sounds great until you dig deeper and uncover ethical and social issues. Examples of ethical concerns include the potential for exacerbating social inequalities, issues around informed consent, and the risk of eugenics-like practices.  Those in favour mention that this is just the next stage of human evolution. While plants and fruits have been genetically modified for centuries, humans possess greater biological complexity and ethical considerations, requiring careful regulation beyond simple evolutionary steps. We have improved plants and fruits through genetic modifications for millennia; why not apply this to humans next? If we can eliminate diseases such as cancers, this can only be a good thing. The secondary benefits are also said to be great. There will be less illness, fewer sick days, more economic productivity. Our quality of life will improve significantly.  Those against the idea might argue that we are playing God and we are meddling with nature. Many religious groups have historically been against such issues. It would probably be very expensive and only wealthy families would be able to afford it thus widening the societal gaps between rich and poor. Governments could implement subsidies or enforce universal healthcare coverage for genetic therapies to prevent socioeconomic disparities in access. For example, cutting-edge treatments like IVF and gene therapies have initially been accessible only to affluent groups, deepening health inequality. Many biologists say we would have a loss of biodiversity, with only a relatively small number of traits being chosen. The slippery slope here is that we do not stop with diseases, but then begin to choose physical characteristics also. Bioethicists warn that initial acceptance of genetic disease prevention could lead to designer babies, as seen in debates on cosmetic genetic enhancements. We have also seen that small changes to complex biological systems can have drastic consequences, for example with the climate. For example, off-target gene edits can cause unintended mutations, potentially resulting in new diseases or harmful traits. Who knows what unforeseen consequences this might cause.  A compromise focusing on targeted benefits would be sensible and this technology is likely to continue. Therefore, while genetic editing holds significant promise to eliminate disease, strict ethical frameworks and equitable access must be established to prevent misuse and social disparity.   "

In general, it could be argued that parents have an ethical responsibility to care for their child and thus have the right to assist their unborn child. This would not only help the child when they are born, but also greatly decrease the burden on the parents. There are many arguments for the cause such as the prevention of hereditary diseases such as cystic fibrosis, which in turn would lead to lower medical costs for the family in the long term. The government would also benefit from the burden being quelled as they could use the funds elsewhere - perhaps they could further research into other modifications (such as cancer or Parkinson's). However, this further raises the question of: what counts as a disease?  Furthermore, perhaps it could also be stated that despite parents having an ethical responsibility for their child, the way they are born is only natural and thus should not be altered. This also raises the issue of consent when in the future, genetic modification could be used for further editing (e.g. eye colour, skin colour).

I will argue that eradicating serious congenital disease and genetic defects would not run the risk of upsetting natural human diversity, as severe genetic defects and congenital disease can be incompatible with life or severely life-limiting. ","Genetic modification is an ethical dilemma which has the potential to give rise to concerns such as “designer babies” and even eugenics. As such it is natural to feel concerned that allowing parents the right to genetically edit embryos could lead to a moral crisis, and thinning the pool of natural human diversity.   Whilst such concerns are understandable, and I would not argue for unfettered access to genetic modification, I feel that it is a bit of a straw man argument when in the pursuit of avoiding serious genetic defects and congenital disease. Many serious genetic defects can result in conditions that are incompatible with life, or are life-limiting - for example anencephaly and certain trisomies. These children are unlikely to be born, or survive infancy / childhood and thus would not go on to contribute to the genetic pool of natural human diversity in any event.  In addition to this, such serious congenital disease and genetic defects can result in immense emotional and financial burdens, both to the parents and immediate family, and to the healthcare system respectively. As a parent myself that has had to make very difficult decisions after having a pregnancy ending with a termination for medical reasons due to anencephaly, and a subsequent successful but fraught pregnancy with concerns of trisomies (edwards / patau) requiring chorionic villus sampling, I can attest that these experiences were deeply distressing and had a lasting impact. I was rendered completely unable to enjoy my successful pregnancy and was riddled with anxiety when my ultimately healthy baby was born.

No, I don't think that would be a good idea. There could potentially be lots of problems if this process would be allowed.

This is not what should happen in real life. We are all different and it is not possible to diminish all diseases. Diseases will be happing even if the genetic make up of unborn children would be changed to prevent diseases. There may be diseases in the future that we don't know about just yet and changing the genetic make up is against the nature.  Well, if one consider what is happening with genetically modified food. People are frightened to purchase genetically modified produce as there are health risks. And once we start playing with genetics, no-one could predict where it would lead. We may even make diseases that would otherwise not happen. The idea might sound very good to genetically edit the parents' unborn child to prevent diseases, however, is it safe? Genetically modified food has it's disadvantages. Genetic engineering poses some risks to people's health such as it can cause allergic reactions, it can be even toxic and create antibiotic resistance. These things could be dangerous to human health. Also there are concerns that genetically modified food is connected to some forms of cancer and immuno-supression. These are all concerns with genetically modified crops. Now we talk about altering genetic make up of our future generations. These are very dangerous steps to take.

There's no clearer evidence of that than in Generations Z and Alpha, who largely grew up with smartphones from childhood onward, and have (even accounting for the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic) had some of the most substantial proficiency dips in the history of American public education. It's obvious, at this point, that something must be done: Schools need to ban general use of smartphones, providing only a limited use case in the event of emergencies, and potentially as a carefully administered supplement to in-class learning.  An outright ban would be foolhardy, of course, since many (if not most) students would move heaven and earth to circumvent that ban. Certainly, the zero-tolerance policies of the 2000s (when cell phones were, ironically, only a fraction as distracting) mostly just taught students when and where to hide their phones from teachers and staff.

While there are some genuinely useful applications for smartphone use in the classroom (e.g., using mobile apps to answer quizzes) they are, of course, limited. Generally speaking, the chance for distraction is too great to allow unrestricted phone access during classroom hours, except in cases of confirmed emergencies.

6729f313d7f4a118598bc4cf,4,a2,"The idea of reviving an extinct species has always been a tempting one. There is some merit in this, if it pertains to species that were wiped out by human intervention in the last 100 years. I don't consider that an arbitrary number, and it is also why I don't think otherwise extinct species should be ""brought back"".  With the genetic tools currently available and enough viable physical matter, it would be possible to reconstruct a facsimile of an extinct species, such as the woolly mammoth. However, that is all it would be--a facsimile. The idea is to attempt to modify the DNA of an existing species that is related to the mammoth to some degree, such as an elephant. The end result might look something like a woolly mammoth and even share some DNA with a woolly mammoth, but in reality it would just be a hairier elephant.   For the sake of argument, let us assume it would be possible to perfectly clone an animal from the source material without having to modify the genetics of an existing species. I still think this would be a bad idea, and that brings us back to my comment about the last 100 years. The ecological context of the mammoth no longer exists. They would not be able to be released into the wild because the wild that remains is not one that can effectively support a woolly mammoth. If it could, there would probably still be woolly mammoths, assuming humans hadn't wiped them out by now, which is a distinct possibility. The only point of cloning such a creature is to have it as a curiosity, to do it for the sake of novelty. It has nothing to do with the well-being of the creature.   Yet, why would I support the idea of using genetic engineering to bring back a more recently extinct species? Because its habitat might still exist. There would be a space for those animals to return to the wild. It's a legitimate way to make use of that kind of technology.","An extinct species is extinct for a reason. Sometimes this is due to a catastrophic event, or a milder yet inexorable change in habitat. These changes can occur with or without the intervention of humans. The idea of reviving an extinct species can be an exciting one, but in general I don't think it should be done, with the exception of recently extinct animals that were wiped out because of human interference.   The primary reason against the idea is that the resultant animal will only ever be a reconstructed facsimile of the extinct species. With long dead species, the best that can be done with the current technology is to tamper with the DNA of a closely related animal; with the woolly mammoth, that would be an elephant. The end result might look like a woolly mammoth but in reality it would simply be a hairier than average elephant.   For the sake of argument, let us assume it would be possible to perfectly clone an animal from the source material without having to modify the genetics of an existing species. The primary issue with this is that this species no longer has an appropriate habitat; it cannot be released into the wild. Its only reason for being is for the novelty of seeing a long-dead species, for doing it simply because it can be done. This does not take into account the well-being of the ""revived"" species at all. If the environment could still support the woolly mammoth, then the woolly mammoth probably would not have gone extinct when it did.  However, I would support the idea of using these genetic tools to bring back a more recently extinct species, one that was wiped out in the last 100 years or so. It is possible that the habitats for these species might still exist as they did. That would give them a place to return to the wild without unbalancing the ecology of that environment. This kind of technology should not be wasted on curiosities just to sate the ego of the people who are doing it to prove that they can. It should be used to make up for the massive amount of destruction caused by human civilization that has caused the extinction of so many species within living memory.

Although some public schools have placed certain restrictions in the use of smartphones in the school premises, others have not laid down the restrictions required. Schools that have not not placed restrictions on the use of smartphones tend to have the student not performing very well in the school work.  According to my opinion, public schools should ban the use of smartphones during class hours in order to engage the learners in class work strictly.  The school can also lay down rules and specify the times when the use of smartphones is allowed in class. By doing this the instructor will have a very easy time teaching and the learners will also have an easy time concentrating in classwork. In conclusion, I would like to say that banning smart phones in public schools during class time is very important because it will greatly influence the performance of the students in a positive way."

Many students have smartphones that they bring to schools. These are used for calling, texting, social media, gaming etc among students. Students use it in their daily life, making it a part of their routines. Because smartphones are an important part of lives of students now a days, there is a big debate among schools whether to ban them or not, as it can affect the students learning.    There are two opinions on this, either banning it or not. Some argue that smartphones are a big distraction while leaning in classes. Students rarely spend time focusing on their course, thy play games on their smartphones and mare mostly seen busy using social media. Smartphones make it very easy to cheat in exams, there are no clear regulations or boundaries for that.  By banning smartphones in schools, students will have more time to focus on their studies and avoid these serious distractions.  On the other hand, there is an option of limited use of smartphones in schools. Smartphones are also a great learning tool in today's developing world. Students can make positive use of them by looking up definitions of term, using educational apps or websites, and portals to engage in online educational activities to boost their learning. Smartphones also prove to be really useful in emergencies. If a students gets hurt or falls sick during school hours, they can easily inform their parents. In this way, smartphones can be useful for the students in schools.

Parent's right to choose if this is available and done ethically  Main:  If we can prevent suffering and disease, then we should.  Misuse can be prevented if there are strong things in place to ensure ethical procedures. Parents won't be able to genetically alter for things like eye color. only things that would be detrimental to a child  Close:  Allowing this to prevent disease is compassionate and beneficial to children and society. It would help to make sure that the struggles that families and children face due to genetic mutations that cause disease, abnormalities, and suffering do not exist anymore  ","There can be a world where children are born without unnecessary suffering if parents use genetic editing responsibly. Genetic editing is a way for families to prevent serious conditions before birth. This is a much more compassionate thing to do than let a child suffer with something that could have been prevented. When science moves forward, we should embrace it and do the same. It is better for society.  People who think this should be banned, are worried about the ethical nature of ""playing God"". I don't see genetic editing this way. It is not going to be used to do things like create a baby genius with blue eyes and blond hair. As long as there are measures in place to ensure proper use, this scientific advance allows us to alleviate suffering. Think of it as similar to the way that the development of vaccines has eliminated some diseases or things like mammograms have caught breast cancer before it becomes deadly.  The argument that genetic modifications preserve human diversity is not the same as preventing illness. Is the human race better when we have serious ill and suffering people? I don't think so. If this is allowed, it won't reduce human diversity, it will make future generations that are more productive and thriving.  In the long run, genetic editing is not a threat. It is a promise. It allows us to prevent disease and is a responsible thing to do. There will be fewer hospital visits, fewer health costs for the entire society, and much less suffering for children and families. There would also be less of a burden on the health system. We should embrace the ability to do this in order to let children live full and vibrant lives.

65e1f75ab3efd22e847cfbf0,1,b3,I believe that the federal government should not broaden student-loan forgiveness programs but rather tackle the true source. The colleges are charging more and more for degrees and where is the justification in that. The colleges have gotten out of hand and there needs to be the government to step in and hold the colleges accountable and in check. We need to fix the price of college.,"I believe that the federal government should not really go after broadening student-loan forgiveness because it does not actually fix the issue of the student loan crisis here in the United States. The colleges every single year over many decades keep increasing the price of tuition and other fees that have made affording college impossible. College is not affordable and no longer accessible for all. They have made college so expensive that taking out large loans for education is now the norm and now standard. They may say oh its okay because you can take out loans but it is not fixing the issue. It is a bandaid and making this worse. We are letting young people go straigt into college and take thousands if not hundreds of thousands of dollar out in loans with no promise of jobs. The degrees are now being eroded by AI and the workforce right now is making it hard for new grads to get into entry level jobs.   Degrees are not keeping up with the times and they are not getting people truly ready for the workforce at all. Degrees are costing more than peoples yearly salary's and that to me in insane. Where is the justification in that, that they can charge that. I have a cousin who is almost two-hundred thousand in debt. That is more than a mortgage and she can't even get a job in her degree field. I know countless others who went into a lot of debt for their degree. Maybe down the road the degree will be worth it but right now it isn't. The government needs to step in and fix the underlying issues of the college degree and the costs of it. There are many paths the government can take to do so.

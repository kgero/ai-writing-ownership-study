I understand you didn’t want to give free amount of time as we may have taken forever and been more wordy than we should have been but to revise an essay for final draft in 10 mins is wild I wish I had more time I felt rushed and I don’t personally like writing like that lol I still feel it’s mine if there was an offer of an ai to help me I’m not sure where it was I was so rushed I messed it I guess. ",Because like I said I felt very rushed and kinda panicked lucky for me I’m really very well educated in the eco topics so I could write a pursuasive argument for the topic but because I was so rushed I missed it if you had any ai tools available to me for sure I was just trying to write and rewrite so it was coherent and sounded like I I am educated (ha ha it’s hard when your rushed to even think of using a bot especially now knowing where it was to get its help) ,"I said this multiple times now it’s not enough time I feel like there was so much I wanted to say I’m not sure where this fits in say in the context of a real world scenario: because yes if given time constraints that are so extreme like this was of given the chance I would have come up with my own ideas my own bullets per say and I would have then had an ai help me write it out in here if provided and if I had permission to utilize it to write with me. I get the moral implications of some things like universities not wanting student to just have ai do the work, that’s not the complete way it should be I agree on that point. However I’m a forward thinker, an out of the box standing up on it telling the world how I see things kind of person. That said I think there is a place for ai in education, if we started to teach kids at a young age that ai is a tool like a calculator or a computer might be, that help you with researching bouncing off ideas checking your work and helping to revise things like this even rewriting your incoherent throat streams to be beautifully written stories or research papers, essays anything really, the point is the more you tell a kid they can’t do something the more they will try to do it it’s got to be some sort of weird deep down ingrained survival instinct maybe. Who knows but I’m living proof of it. I was not allowed to eat sugar as a kid (adhd diagnosis at 7 deemed severe) I got ice cream and sodas once in awhile but I grew up being active members of a health food co-op and I learned early to read labels because my mom wouldn’t buy things like snacks or cereals that had sugar or a red dye in them. So point is I was denied sugar for the most part. At 18 when I went to college I was on my own I ate and drank nothing but sugar, sodas, ice cream, candy processed foods garbage for an entire year all snacks and meals were comprised of some combination of those items. Yep went crazy eating it all. When I started a family I vowed to myself and the universe I would never deny my children anything they wanted I would teach them natural moderation and natural hunger as well. So today my oldest son is 26, my youngest child my daughter is 19 I have 2 other boys in the middle of them all 4 are very healthy athletic active humans they all moderate themselves they eat when they are hungry not because a clock seems it national lunch time, they eat sweets and drink sodas but also choose water and juices as well. They are all highly intelligent and succeed in all aspects of life. Are all generally happy well rounded people. We have a relationship of respect and trust and love but above all nurturing and understanding without judgement. 

The point I’m trying to make is figure it out seriously figure out some educational breakthrough that allows them to learn to use ai as a tool to assist them in life and work and everyday mundane things. I in no way think they will become complacent and lazy children live to learn but our academic institution is so flawed and archaic it’s laughable. The important things should be stressed in educating first even if you restrict the use in schools or on school projects your ultimately hurting the students that are falling behind but don’t or can’t ask for help they need so to help them for awhile almost every ai tool will explain how and why they arrived at the answers to questions and what is it that it’s doing it’s teaching them how it’s done and if the kids interact thoughtfully engaging with it the bots will stick with them until they understand the topic fully. 

Look into that do a study on all that I bet you’d be surprised it you choose say a grade level to follow along with that’s allowed to use ai test them at the end of the year against a class of non ai user students they are going to prob be equal or higher level intelligence and know about the same stuff if not more have a better understand and get higher grades. 

Just my thoughts sorry for typos I’m typing fast I have to go do something in a min sorry it’s so long as well but I think if studied you’d see I’m right. ",676276312d87ec9601be7d5c,a2,1

A lot of the text I'd written still seemed to be present on the AI's first draft, however the AI did add one or two paragraphs of its own, and it did add a more professional approach to some of the words I'd written.

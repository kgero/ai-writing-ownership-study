Many students have smartphones that they bring to schools. These are used for calling, texting, social media, gaming etc among students. Students use it in their daily life, making it a part of their routines. Because smartphones are an important part of lives of students now a days, there is a big debate among schools whether to ban them or not, as it can affect the students learning. \n \nThere are two opinions on this, either banning it or not. Some argue that smartphones are a big distraction while leaning in classes. Students rarely spend time focusing on their course, thy play games on their smartphones and mare mostly seen busy using social media. Smartphones make it very easy to cheat in exams, there are no clear regulations or boundaries for that.  By banning smartphones in schools, students will have more time to focus on their studies and avoid these serious distractions.\n\nOn the other hand, there is an option of limited use of smartphones in schools. Smartphones are also a great learning tool in today's developing world. Students can make positive use of them by looking up definitions of term, using educational apps or websites, and portals to engage in online educational activities to boost their learning. Smartphones also prove to be really useful in emergencies. If a students gets hurt or falls sick during school hours, they can easily inform their parents. In this way, smartphones can be useful for the students in schools.\n\nIt can be concluded that public schools should place restrictions on usage of phones in schools, Having a balanced approach towards their use in school could lead to a balanced and focus atmosphere for learning and growoth for the students in the public schools.", "ai_likelihood": 4.2484866248236765e-05, "prediction": "Unlikely AI", "llm_prediction": {"GPT35": 0.0, "GPT4": 0.0, "CLAUDE": 0.0, "GOOGLE": 0.0, "OPENAI_O_SERIES": 0.0, "DEEPSEEK": 0.0, "GROK": 0.0, "NOVA": 0.0, "OTHER": 0.0, "HUMAN": 0.0}, "metadata": {}}

On one hand parents want to do the best they could to have a healthy baby and this is natural for parents since they naturally want the best for their children, and having the assurance of having a kid free from any congenital and inherited disesases must be comforting.This is will also reduce mortality cases especially in children since alot of children die before the age of five due to congenital and inherited problems \n\nOn the other hand, many people fear that genetic modification wont stop at eliminating diseaes but will go deeper into issues such as modifying the babies intelligence, appearance gender and  athletic ability. This could reduce the natural diversity that occurs in humans since one can literally buy whatever trait they desire which in the normal world money cant buy everything. This will lead to inequality since only the rich can afford these procedures. Making kids of the rich smarter more fit and visually appeapling which is not fair. Those who will not be able to afford this kind of procedires will feel discouraged to procreat since they feel like other kids have an upper hand in terms of their inteliggence and looks on top of their parents been wealthy. This will decrease the number of parents giving birth annually\n\nWe need to find a way to use this new technology more responsibly since its a good  achievement but still the risk is very high and this could lead to a crisis. We need to find a balance between the good sides which can be used to better the health of individuals and put serious measures and punishments for those who deviate from the set limit.", "ai_likelihood": 2.317958407931858e-07, "prediction": "Unlikely AI", "llm_prediction": {"GPT35": 0.0, "GPT4": 0.0, "CLAUDE": 0.0, "GOOGLE": 0.0, "OPENAI_O_SERIES": 0.0, "DEEPSEEK": 0.0, "GROK": 0.0, "NOVA": 0.0, "OTHER": 0.0, "HUMAN": 0.0}, "metadata": {}}

Genetic editing is a way for families to prevent serious conditions before birth. This is a much more compassionate thing to do than let a child suffer with something that could have been prevented. When science moves forward, we should embrace it and do the same. It is better for society.\n\nPeople who think this should be banned, are worried about the ethical nature of \"playing God\". I don't see genetic editing this way. It is not going to be used to do things like create a baby genius with blue eyes and blond hair. As long as there are measures in place to ensure proper use, this scientific advance allows us to alleviate suffering. Think of it as similar to the way that the development of vaccines has eliminated some diseases or things like mammograms have caught breast cancer before it becomes deadly.  The argument that genetic modifications preserve human diversity is not the same as preventing illness. Is the human race better when we have serious ill and suffering people? I don't think so. If this is allowed, it won't reduce human diversity, it will make future generations that are more productive and thriving.\n\nIn the long run, genetic editing is not a threat. It is a promise. It allows us to prevent disease and is a responsible thing to do. There will be fewer hospital visits, fewer health costs for the entire society, and much less suffering for children and families. There would also be less of a burden on the health system. We should embrace the ability to do this in order to let children live full and vibrant lives.

Thanks to rapid advances in Genetic capabilities, this is now closer to reality than fiction- and is something researchers are actively looking into. Yet, the question remains, should we do it? Is this a line we can afford to cross? \n\nOn the surface, the idea seems a compelling one, bringing back mamoths for one could be potentially positive for the eco-system.

Reviving some species could also lead to breakthroughs in genetic engineering, with spillover benefits in areas such as medicine and agriculture. There is also the alure beyond science, the curiosity of the masses. a general wonder and the hope that with such achievements, then surely we can fix the damage we've caused to the planet. \n\nHowever, the case against de-extinction is equally strong- if not stronger. Ethical questions arise immidiately. Would the resurected animals enjoy the same quality of life as they had in their prehistric eras? Who decides if, where and when the species are brought back? Equally important are the resources that would be used. Is this the best use of these resources? \n\nIn weighing both sides, I tend to proceed with caution. The technical aspect of bringing them is without a doubt impressive. But capability and responsibility are two different things. Who would shoulder these responsibilities?

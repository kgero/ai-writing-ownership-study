The Case Against Bans (Why Equipment Choice Should Remain Local/Individual)\n\nCost and Economic Burden\n\nBans would impose high costs on small landscaping businesses.\n\nBattery/electric blowers can be twice as expensive and require multiple batteries for a day\u2019s work.\n\nPerformance and Reliability\n\nGas blowers provide longer run times and higher power, especially useful on large properties.\n\nElectric alternatives may not handle heavy, wet leaves or extended workdays.\n\nFairness and Autonomy\n\nResidents and landscapers should have the right to decide what tools to use on private property.\n\nGovernment mandates risk overreach into personal and business decisions.\n\nJob and Productivity Impacts\n\nReduced efficiency could drive up landscaping costs for homeowners.\n\nCould put extra strain on workers who must complete jobs with less powerful tools.\n\nII. Weaknesses in the Case for Bans\n\nNoise Concerns\n\nSubjective; many common city noises (traffic, construction) are equally or more disruptive.\n\nRestrictions on hours of operation can address this without outright bans.\n\nPollution Concerns\n\nGas blower emissions are relatively small compared to vehicles and industrial sources.\n\nTechnology is improving \u2014 newer, cleaner models reduce emissions significantly.\n\nHealth & Environmental Arguments\n\nExposure risks are limited mainly to operators, who can mitigate with protective equipment.\n\nConcerns about soil/wildlife disturbance are minor compared to other human activities (construction, mowing, etc.).\n\nIII.

There is some merit in this, if it pertains to species that were wiped out by human intervention in the last 100 years. I don't consider that an arbitrary number, and it is also why I don't think otherwise extinct species should be \"brought back\".\n\nWith the genetic tools currently available and enough viable physical matter, it would be possible to reconstruct a facsimile of an extinct species, such as the woolly mammoth. However, that is all it would be--a facsimile. The idea is to attempt to modify the DNA of an existing species that is related to the mammoth to some degree, such as an elephant. The end result might look something like a woolly mammoth and even share some DNA with a woolly mammoth, but in reality it would just be a hairier elephant. \n\nFor the sake of argument, let us assume it would be possible to perfectly clone an animal from the source material without having to modify the genetics of an existing species. I still think this would be a bad idea, and that brings us back to my comment about the last 100 years. The ecological context of the mammoth no longer exists. They would not be able to be released into the wild because the wild that remains is not one that can effectively support a woolly mammoth. If it could, there would probably still be woolly mammoths, assuming humans hadn't wiped them out by now, which is a distinct possibility. The only point of cloning such a creature is to have it as a curiosity, to do it for the sake of novelty. It has nothing to do with the well-being of the creature. \n\nYet, why would I support the idea of using genetic engineering to bring back a more recently extinct species? Because its habitat might still exist. There would be a space for those animals to return to the wild.

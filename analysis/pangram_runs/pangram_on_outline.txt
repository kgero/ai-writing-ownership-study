Upon further research, this is when the idea genetically modifying one's child comes into play.\n\nThe idea that scientist, government, as well as the public has is whether or not this, genetically modifying a fetus, is moral or not.

It's a complex matter that must be looked at carefully from both sides.\n\nOne of the big issues I see with genetic modifications is that they will cost money that most people likely cannot afford. This will make the wealth disparity even more severe. Wealthy individuals could, in theory, modify their children to be stronger, smarter, and overall superior. This, in turn, will lead those genetically modified children to have a much higher chance of succeeding compared to their non-genetically modified peers.\n\nOne of the main reasons I think it could be imperative to use genetic editing on an unborn child is that it could remove certain major genetic defects that could spread throughout humanity, given enough time. We could also rid humanity of other diseases, perhaps such as sickle cell. Rather than needing to introduce more vaccines, we could get ahead of the curve by removing or editing out certain traits that could cause harm in the future. \n\nThe idea of humanity changing so broadly using a new technology is an interesting but scary thought.

For some, making regular payments can still result in accumulated interest that never seems to go down. Student's should not be punished for trying to better themselves and their lives, and student loan debt only punishes lower-income individuals, leaving them to flounder while high-income families and individuals get to keep moving ahead.\n\nThesis: The federal government should broaden studen loan forgiveness programs and address education debt to allow students from all backgrounds and financial status to pursue higher education, to help them succeed in life, and to give them a chance to settle into adulthood at their own pace without debt hanging over their head.\n\nParagraph 1: Allowing all students to pursue education regardless of wealth or background\n\nParagraph 2: Help them succeed in life. Prices keep going up and wages keep staying the same. Tack on student loan interest, and you are just beating them over the head and not giving them any options to get to the same level as those without debt.\n\nParagraph 3: Give students a change to discover themselves and settle into adulthood. Students should have debt when they are barely even adults. 18 is young, and giving young adults time to discover their passions and settle down without having debt hanging over their heads can lead to more productive, successful, and well-adjusted individuals.\n\nConclusion: Ultimately, the federal government should broaden student loan forgiveness programs and allow students to pursue higher education because they want to and are passionate. They shouldn't feel like the choice to go to college will leave them floundering and struggling for the rest of their lives. This needs to be addressed.
